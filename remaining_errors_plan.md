# Plan for Resolving Remaining TypeScript Errors

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for addressing the remaining 934 TypeScript errors in the EdPsych Connect platform codebase.

## Error Analysis and Categorization
- [ ] Extract error patterns from typescript_errors.log
- [ ] Categorize errors by type (interface issues, function parameters, return types, etc.)
- [ ] Identify the most problematic files by error count
- [ ] Create a prioritized list of files to fix

## Fix Implementation Strategy
- [ ] Develop specialized fix scripts for common error patterns
- [ ] Create targeted manual fixes for unique or complex cases
- [ ] Address index signature issues in complex objects
- [ ] Fix function parameter and return type annotations
- [ ] Resolve remaining interface and type definition issues

## Validation and Iteration
- [ ] Rerun TypeScript type check after each batch of fixes
- [ ] Track progress by monitoring error count reduction
- [ ] Iterate on fix strategies based on results
- [ ] Continue until error count is minimized

## Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] Document all fixes and patterns addressed
- [ ] Generate comprehensive diff of changes
- [ ] Commit and push fixes in batches
- [ ] Report progress and next steps to user
