# Mobile Responsiveness and Offline Capabilities Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the EdPsych Connect platform with comprehensive mobile responsiveness and offline capabilities. These enhancements will ensure that all users, including students, educators, and parents, can access the platform seamlessly across various devices and network conditions.

## Mobile Responsiveness Requirements

### Core Responsive Design Principles
- Implement fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Use relative units (rem, em, %) instead of fixed pixel values
- Ensure touch-friendly interface elements with appropriate sizing and spacing
- Optimize typography for readability on small screens
- Implement responsive images that load appropriately for device capabilities

### Device Support
- Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android mobile devices
- Support tablet devices of various screen sizes
- Maintain functionality on older devices with limited capabilities
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

### User Interface Adaptations
- Implement collapsible navigation for mobile views
- Create mobile-optimized forms with appropriate input types
- Adapt data visualizations to be meaningful on smaller screens
- Ensure modal dialogs and popovers are usable on touch devices
- Implement touch-friendly drag-and-drop interfaces where needed

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize asset loading for mobile networks
- Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical content
- Minimize JavaScript bundle sizes through code splitting
- Reduce CSS file sizes through optimization
- Implement server-side rendering for faster initial page loads

## Offline Capabilities Requirements

### Core Offline Functionality
- Implement service workers for offline content caching
- Create offline-first architecture for critical features
- Develop synchronization mechanisms for offline data
- Provide clear user feedback about online/offline status
- Ensure graceful degradation of features when offline

### Content Availability
- Cache curriculum content for offline access
- Store personalized learning paths locally
- Make assessment content available offline
- Ensure learning resources are accessible without network
- Cache user progress and analytics data

### Data Synchronization
- Implement background synchronization when connection is restored
- Develop conflict resolution strategies for data changes
- Prioritize critical data for synchronization
- Provide transparent feedback during sync processes
- Ensure data integrity across online and offline states

### User Experience Considerations
- Provide clear indicators of offline mode
- Communicate which features are available offline
- Implement notifications for successful synchronization
- Allow users to manually trigger synchronization
- Provide storage management options for users with limited device space

## Accessibility Considerations
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in responsive designs
- Ensure touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (minimum 44x44px)
- Maintain appropriate color contrast on all device sizes
- Ensure screen reader compatibility in offline mode
- Test voice input features on mobile devices

## UK Educational Context
- Ensure mobile experience aligns with UK educational standards
- Consider limited device access scenarios in UK schools
- Address data usage concerns for students with limited data plans
- Support offline homework and revision capabilities
- Consider safeguarding requirements in mobile contexts

## Implementation Approach
- Audit existing components for mobile responsiveness
- Develop mobile-first enhancements for problematic areas
- Implement progressive web app (PWA) capabilities
- Create comprehensive testing protocol across devices
- Develop documentation for offline usage

## Success Criteria
- All platform features function correctly on mobile devices
- Critical learning features are available offline
- Performance metrics meet or exceed industry standards
- User testing confirms intuitive mobile experience
- Synchronization processes maintain data integrity
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is maintained across all screen sizes
