# EdPsych AI Education Platform - Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the cleanup and code quality improvements made to the EdPsych AI Education Platform codebase. The focus has been on improving type safety, eliminating ESLint errors and warnings, and ensuring the codebase is build-ready.

## Completed Tasks

### Setup and Preparation
- [x] Implemented auto-backup script for continuous backup to GitHub
- [x] Verified TypeScript strict mode is enabled in tsconfig.json
- [x] Enhanced ESLint configuration with stricter rules

### Type Safety Improvements
- [x] Replaced 'any' types with proper interfaces in accessibility components:
  - Keyboard navigation page
  - Screen reader optimization page
  - Text-to-speech page
  - High contrast mode engine
- [x] Replaced 'any' types with proper interfaces in adaptive complexity components:
  - Adaptive complexity page
  - Adaptive complexity engine
- [x] Added proper interfaces and return types to API routes:
  - AI accessibility route
  - AI adaptive complexity route
  - Special needs mindfulness route
  - Professional development routes (main, webinar, community, cpd-tracking)
  - Resource recommendations route
  - Restorative justice routes (conversation-frameworks, reflection-prompts, community-building, parent-education, agreement-tracking)
  - Staff training routes (progress, certificate, modules)
- [x] Added null checks to API routes for improved stability
- [x] Fixed type errors in utility functions, particularly in AI service

### Test File Improvements
- [x] Fixed ESLint errors in test files
- [x] Updated Jest references to Vitest in test files
- [x] Added proper ESLint directives to test files

### Backup and Continuity
- [x] Created auto-backup script that commits to a separate branch every 15 minutes
- [x] Implemented documentation-first workflow with small, incremental changes
- [x] Set up progress tracking system to maintain continuity

## Current Status
All critical build-blocking issues have been resolved. The remaining tasks include:
- Replacing any types in remaining components
- Replacing any types in lib/ directory
- Removing unused variables in components

The codebase is now significantly cleaner, more type-safe, and closer to being build-ready. All changes have been committed to the GitHub repository with detailed commit messages.
