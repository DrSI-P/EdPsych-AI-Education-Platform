# EdPsych AI Education Platform - Backup and Continuity Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the backup and continuity strategy for the EdPsych AI Education Platform development process. The strategy is designed to mitigate the risk of sandbox crashes and ensure that progress is preserved even in the event of technical failures.

## Backup Mechanisms

### 1. Regular Git Commits and Pushes

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto-backup.sh - Script to automatically commit and push changes

# Configuration
BACKUP_INTERVAL=15 # minutes
BRANCH_NAME="auto-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
REPO_DIR="/home/ubuntu/EdPsych"

# Create backup branch if it doesn't exist
cd $REPO_DIR
git checkout -b $BRANCH_NAME 2>/dev/null || git checkout $BRANCH_NAME

while true; do
  # Add all changes
  git add -A
  
  # Commit with timestamp
  git commit -m "Auto-backup: $(date)"
  
  # Push to remote
  git push origin $BRANCH_NAME
  
  echo "Backup completed at $(date)"
  
  # Wait for next backup
  sleep $(($BACKUP_INTERVAL * 60))
done
```

### 2. Task-Based Commits

For each completed task:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Task: [TASK_NAME] - [DESCRIPTION]"
git push origin main
```

### 3. External File Backups

Critical files will be periodically archived and shared:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-backup-archive.sh - Script to create backup archives

BACKUP_DIR="/home/ubuntu/backups"
REPO_DIR="/home/ubuntu/EdPsych"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Create archive
cd $REPO_DIR
zip -r $BACKUP_DIR/edpsych_backup_$TIMESTAMP.zip .

echo "Backup archive created at $BACKUP_DIR/edpsych_backup_$TIMESTAMP.zip"
```

## Progress Tracking

### Progress Log File

A `progress.md` file will be maintained to track completed tasks:

```markdown
# EdPsych AI Education Platform - Progress Log

## Phase 1: Code Quality Cleanup

### TypeScript Strict Mode Implementation
- [x] Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json (2025-05-24)
- [ ] Replace any types in components/
- [ ] Replace any types in lib/
- [ ] Add null checks to API routes

### Unused Code Elimination
- [ ] Remove unused variables in components/
- [ ] Remove unused imports in pages/
- [ ] Delete commented-out code blocks

...
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Documentation First**:
   - Document implementation plan for each task
   - Push documentation to GitHub
   - Begin implementation only after documentation is secured

2. **Small, Atomic Tasks**:
   - Break down each phase into small, independent tasks
   - Complete and push each task before moving to the next
   - Update progress.md after each task

3. **Regular Checkpoints**:
   - Create named checkpoints at logical milestones
   - Tag important commits for easy reference
   - Push tags to GitHub

## Recovery Procedures

In the event of a sandbox crash:

1. Clone the repository fresh
2. Check the latest auto-backup branch
3. Review progress.md to identify the last completed task
4. Resume work from the last checkpoint

## Communication Protocol

If a sandbox crash occurs:

1. Notify the user immediately
2. Provide a summary of preserved work
3. Outline the recovery plan
4. Resume work as quickly as possible

This comprehensive backup and continuity strategy ensures that development progress is preserved and that work can continue efficiently even in the face of technical challenges.
