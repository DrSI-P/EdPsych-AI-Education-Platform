# Data Visualisation Dashboard

## Overview

The Data Visualisation Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics solution designed to provide educators, administrators, and other stakeholders with intuitive, interactive visualisations of educational data across the platform. This powerful tool transforms complex datasets into actionable insights, supporting evidence-based decision-making and continuous improvement in educational practices.

## Educational Psychology Foundations

This dashboard is grounded in established educational psychology principles:

- **Data-Informed Practise**: Supporting evidence-based educational approaches through accessible analytics
- **Growth Mindset**: Focusing on progress and improvement rather than fixed outcomes
- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Enhancing educator understanding of teaching and learning patterns
- **Differentiated Instruction**: Providing insights to tailor approaches to diverse student needs
- **Ecological Systems Perspective**: Visualising interconnections between various educational factors
