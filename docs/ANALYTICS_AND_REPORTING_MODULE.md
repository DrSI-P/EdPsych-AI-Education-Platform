# Analytics and Reporting Module Design Document

## Overview

The Analytics and Reporting Module extends the existing data visualization capabilities of the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform to provide comprehensive insights, custom reporting, and advanced analytics across all platform features. This module will serve as a central hub for data-driven decision making, enabling educators, administrators, and other stakeholders to track progress, measure impact, and identify areas for improvement.

## Design Principles

1. **Integration-First Approach**: Build upon and extend existing dashboard components rather than replacing them
2. **Modular Architecture**: Create independent but interconnected analytics components
3. **Accessibility by Design**: Ensure all visualizations and reports are fully accessible
4. **Privacy-Aware Analytics**: Implement appropriate data anonymization and aggregation
5. **Evidence-Based Insights**: Focus on actionable insights grounded in educational research
6. **UK Educational Framework Alignment**: Ensure metrics and reporting align with UK standards
