# Schema Fix and Migration Report

## Issue Summary

The Prisma schema had several issues that needed to be fixed:

1. **Merge Conflicts**: The schema contained merge conflicts between local and remote changes.
2. **Duplicate Model Definitions**: Several models were defined multiple times in the schema.
3. **Missing Model References**: The User model had references to models that were not properly defined in the schema.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Fix Schema Conflicts

Created a script (`fix-schema-conflicts.js`) to resolve merge conflicts in the schema file. The script:
- Created a backup of the original schema
- Resolved conflicts by intelligently merging changes from both versions
- Preserved important annotations like `@db.Text` and relationship definitions
- Ensured all required models were properly defined

### 2. Remove Duplicate Models

Created a script (`remove-duplicate-models.js`) to remove duplicate model definitions from the schema. The script:
- Created a backup of the schema
- Processed the schema line by line to identify and remove duplicate model definitions
- Preserved the first occurrence of each model definition
- Successfully removed 8 duplicate model definitions:
  - PortfolioProfile
  - PortfolioQualification
  - PortfolioAchievement
  - PortfolioEvidence
  - PortfolioEvidenceAchievement
  - PortfolioReflection
  - PortfolioReflectionEvidence
  - Certificate

### 3. Fix Mentorship Model

Created a script (`fix-mentorship-model.js`) to add the `@unique` attribute to the `requestId` field in the Mentorship model, which is required for one-to-one relations.

### 4. Generate Prisma Client

Successfully generated the Prisma client with the fixed schema using:
```bash
npx prisma generate --schema=EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform/prisma/schema.prisma
```

## Migration Status

The migration file (`20250522_add_mentorship_and_portfolio_models/migration.sql`) has been prepared and is ready to be applied to the database. The migration includes:

- Creation of new tables for Mentorship models
- Creation of new tables for Portfolio models
- Addition of new relations to the User model

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migration**: Use the `deploy-migration.js` script to apply the migration to the production database.
2. **Update Dependencies**: Consider updating the Prisma dependencies to resolve the version mismatch warning:
   ```bash
   npm i --save-dev prisma@latest
   npm i @prisma/client@latest
   ```
3. **Test API Routes**: Test the mentor-matching and portfolio API routes to ensure they work correctly with the updated schema.
4. **Commit and Push**: Commit the fixed schema and migration files to GitHub.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Validation**: Always validate schema changes before committing them to avoid merge conflicts and duplicate definitions.
2. **Automated Fixes**: Creating scripts to automate the fix process ensures consistency and reduces the risk of manual errors.
3. **Backups**: Always create backups before making changes to critical files like the schema.
4. **Version Control**: Properly managing merge conflicts in version control is essential for collaborative development.
