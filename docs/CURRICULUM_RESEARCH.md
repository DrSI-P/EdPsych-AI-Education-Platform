## Key Structure and Components

The UK National Curriculum is structured around:

### 1. Key Stages

- **Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)**: Ages 3-5 (Nursery and Reception)
- **Key Stage 1**: Ages 5-7 (Years 1-2)
- **Key Stage 2**: Ages 7-11 (Years 3-6)
- **Key Stage 3**: Ages 11-14 (Years 7-9)
- **Key Stage 4**: Ages 14-16 (Years 10-11)
- **Key Stage 5**: Ages 16-18 (Years 12-13) - Not part of the National Curriculum but follows A-Level standards

### 2. Core and Foundation Subjects

#### Core Subjects (all key stages):
- English
- Mathematics
- Science

#### Foundation Subjects (vary by key stage):
- Art and Design
- Citizenship
- Computing
- Design and Technology
- Languages (Foreign)
- Geography
- History
- Music
- Physical Education (PE)

### 3. Programmes of Study

Each subject has a detailed programme of study that outlines:
- Aims and objectives
- Subject content
- Attainment targets
- Assessment criteria

## Implementation Approach

To ensure the integrity and accuracy of the Curriculum Planning module, we are:

1. **Directly referencing official DfE documents** for all curriculum standards and frameworks
2. **Maintaining the exact structure and terminology** used in the National Curriculum
3. **Including all statutory requirements** for each key stage and subject
4. **Regularly updating content** to reflect any changes to the National Curriculum
5. **Providing clear references** to source documents for all curriculum content

## Subject-Specific Standards

For each subject, we are implementing the specific attainment targets and content requirements as outlined in the National Curriculum. This includes:

- **English**: Reading (word reading and comprehension), Writing (transcription, composition, vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation), and Spoken language
- **Mathematics**: Number, Measurement, Geometry, Statistics, Ratio and Proportion (KS2+), and Algebra (KS2+)
- **Science**: Working scientifically, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics topics appropriate to each key stage

## Assessment Framework

The assessment framework is aligned with the National Curriculum assessment structure:

- **Formative assessment**: Ongoing assessment during the learning process
- **Summative assessment**: End of key stage assessments
- **Standardised tests**: Including SATs at the end of KS1 and KS2

## Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND)

In accordance with the UK SEND Code of Practise, our curriculum planning tools include:

- Options for differentiation and personalization
- Support for creating inclusive learning objectives
- Tools for tracking progress against individualized targets

## Ongoing Research and Updates

This document will be regularly updated to reflect:

- Changes to the National Curriculum
- Updates to assessment frameworks
- New DfE guidance and statutory requirements
- Feedback from UK educators using the platform
