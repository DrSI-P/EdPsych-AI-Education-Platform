# EdPsych AI Education Platform Deployment Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve Vercel deployment issues for the EdPsych AI Education Platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UK to US Spelling in Package Names

The deployment was failing due to npm trying to download packages with UK spelling that don't exist in the npm registry. We fixed:

- `@zag-js/colour-picker` → `@zag-js/color-picker`
- `@zag-js/colour-utils` → `@zag-js/color-utils`
- `colour-support` → `color-support`
- Fixed package URLs in package-lock.json that were still using UK spelling

### 2. Previous Fixes

We've also consolidated previous fixes:

- Fixed apostrophes in single quotes causing syntax errors
- Fixed template literals
- Fixed import statements
- Created SimpleTabs component to handle custom props
- Fixed TypeScript errors

## How to Apply the Fixes

We've created a comprehensive script that applies all the fixes:

```bash
cd EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform
node scripts/apply-all-fixes.js
npm install
```

## Deployment Process

After applying the fixes, follow these steps to deploy:

1. **Commit and push changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix package name spelling and other deployment issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Clear Vercel cache and trigger a new deployment**:
   ```bash
   node clear-vercel-cache-and-redeploy.js
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can use the Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to the project settings
   - Find "Build & Development Settings"
   - Click on "Clear Cache and Redeploy"

3. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Check the Vercel deployment logs
   - Ensure there are no errors related to package names or TypeScript

## Troubleshooting

If deployment issues persist:

1. **Check for remaining UK spelling in package names**:
   ```bash
   cd EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform
   grep -r "colour" --include="package*.json" .
   ```

2. **Verify package-lock.json integrity**:
   ```bash
   cd EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Disconnect and reconnect GitHub repository in Vercel**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Project settings
   - Git Integration
   - Disconnect and reconnect the repository
