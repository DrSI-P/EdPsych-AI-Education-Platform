# Emotional Pattern Recognition

## Overview
The Emotional Pattern Recognition feature enhances the platform's emotional regulation support by providing sophisticated data analysis and visualisation of emotional patterns over time. This evidence-based tool helps students identify trends, triggers, and correlations in their emotional experiences, supporting deeper self-awareness and more effective regulation strategies.

## Key Features

- Emotion filtering to focus on specific emotional experiences
- Multiple analysis views (overview, triggers, time patterns, trends)

### Data Export

## Integration
The Emotional Pattern Recognition feature integrates seamlessly with the existing Emotional Regulation Support module, providing deeper insights based on the emotion tracking data already collected through that system.
