# Interactive Assessment Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Interactive Assessment Engine is a comprehensive assessment system for the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform that provides dynamic, adaptive assessments aligned with UK curriculum standards and evidence-based educational psychology principles. The engine supports various assessment types, question formats, and adaptive difficulty levels to create personalized learning experiences.

## Core Components

### 1. Assessment Types and Models

The engine supports multiple assessment types based on educational purpose:
- **Diagnostic Assessments**: Identify starting points and learning gaps
- **Formative Assessments**: Provide ongoing feedback during learning
- **Summative Assessments**: Evaluate learning at the conclusion of units
- **Self-Assessments**: Enable student reflection and metacognition
- **Progress Checks**: Monitor improvement over time

All assessments are aligned with UK Key Stages and subject areas, with explicit curriculum links.

### 2. Question Bank

The Question Bank provides a repository of assessment items with:
- Multiple question types (multiple choice, short answer, matching, etc.)
- Difficulty levels from Beginner to Challenge
- Cognitive domain classification based on Bloom's Taxonomy
- Learning style considerations based on VARK model
- Special educational needs adaptations
- Multilingual support

### 3. Adaptive Difficulty Engine

The Adaptive Difficulty Engine implements evidence-based approaches to personalize assessment difficulty:
- Item Response Theory (IRT) for estimating student ability
- Zone of Proximal Development principles for optimal challenge
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Varied practise to enhance learning and retention

### 4. Feedback Generator

The Feedback Generator provides evidence-based, actionable feedback:
- Specific and focused on the task rather than the person
- Guidance for improvement rather than just correctness
- Support for metacognitive reflection
- Strengths and areas for improvement identification
- Next steps recommendations
- Domain-specific feedback

### 5. Plugin Integration

The assessment engine supports third-party assessment tools through a plugin architecture:
- Standard templates for creating assessment tool plugins
- Conversion utilities for data interchange
- Example implementation with Cognifit cognitive assessments
- Unified interface for both built-in and third-party tools

## Educational Psychology Foundations

The Interactive Assessment Engine is built on established educational psychology principles:

### 1. Cognitive Load Theory
- Questions are designed to optimise cognitive load
- Adaptive difficulty ensures appropriate challenge
- Special educational needs adaptations prevent cognitive overload

### 2. Zone of Proximal Development
- Adaptive difficulty targets each student's optimal challenge level
- Feedback provides scaffolding for improvement
- Progress tracking identifies the next developmental steps

### 3. Formative Assessment Research
- Immediate or delayed feedback options based on learning goals
- Specific, actionable feedback rather than just correctness
- Opportunities for reflection and self-assessment

### 4. Metacognitive Development
- Self-assessment components
- Reflection prompts in feedback
- Strategy suggestions for improvement

### 5. Universal Design for Learning
- Multiple question types to accommodate different learning styles
- Accessibility options for diverse needs
- Multilingual support for language diversity

## UK Curriculum Alignment

All assessments are explicitly aligned with:
- UK Key Stages (Early Years through Key Stage 5)
- Core and foundation subjects
- Specific curriculum objectives and standards
- Age-appropriate content and difficulty

## Technical Implementation

The assessment engine is implemented with:
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Zod schema validation for data integrity
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Plugin system for third-party integrations
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Basic Assessment

```typescript
const assessment: Assessment = {
  metadata: {
    id: uuidv4(),
    title: "Year 7 Mathematics: Number and Place Value",
    description: "Assessment of understanding of number concepts and place value",
    keyStage: UKKeyStage.KEY_STAGE_3,
    subject: UKSubject.MATHEMATICS,
    topics: ["Number", "Place Value", "Integers"],
    assessmentType: AssessmentType.FORMATIVE,
    targetAgeRange: { min: 11, max: 12 },
    estimatedDuration: 20,
    difficultyLevel: DifficultyLevel.INTERMEDIATE,
    createdAt: new Date(),
    updatedAt: new Date()
  },
  questions: [
    // Multiple choice question
    {
      id: uuidv4(),
      type: QuestionType.MULTIPLE_CHOICE,
      text: "What is the value of the digit 7 in the number 3,175?",
      difficultyLevel: DifficultyLevel.INTERMEDIATE,
      cognitiveDomain: CognitiveDomain.UNDERSTAND,
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "7", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "b", text: "70", isCorrect: true },
        { id: "c", text: "700", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "d", text: "7000", isCorrect: false }
      ],
      randomizeOptions: true,
      correctOptionId: "b",
      points: 1
    },
    // Short answer question
    {
      id: uuidv4(),
      type: QuestionType.SHORT_ANSWER,
      text: "Write -8 as a product of its prime factors.",
      difficultyLevel: DifficultyLevel.HIGHER,
      cognitiveDomain: CognitiveDomain.APPLY,
      expectedAnswer: "-2³",
      alternativeAnswers: ["-2×2×2", "-8", "-2^3"],
      caseSensitive: false,
      points: 2
    }
  ],
  settings: {
    randomizeQuestions: false,
    showFeedback: "end",
    passingScore: 60,

  },
  accessibilityOptions: {
    provideSenSupport: true,
    adaptToLearningStyle: true,
    includeMultimodalContent: true
  },
  createdBy: "teacher-123",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
};

// Generate an adaptive assessment
const adaptiveAssessment = await assessmentEngine.generateAssessment(template);
```

### Using a Third-Party Assessment Plugin

// Initialize the Cognifit plugin
const cognifitPlugin = new CognifitAssessmentPlugin();
await cognifitPlugin.configure({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  apiSecret: "your-api-secret"
});
await cognifitPlugin.initialize();

// Register the plugin
await pluginRegistry.registerPlugin(cognifitPlugin);

// Create an assessment using the plugin
const assessmentParams = {
  assessmentType: "diagnostic",
  targetAgeRange: { min: 12, max: 14 },
  subject: "mathematics",
  topics: ["working_memory", "attention", "processing_speed"],
  difficultyLevel: "intermediate",
  questionCount: 20,
  adaptiveDifficulty: true,
