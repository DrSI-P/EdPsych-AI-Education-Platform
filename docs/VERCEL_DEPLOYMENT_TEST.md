# Vercel Deployment Minimal Test

This is a minimal test file to verify Vercel deployment functionality.

## Purpose

This file serves as a simple test to ensure that basic deployment to Vercel is working correctly. By simplifying the deployment process and removing potential sources of errors, we can isolate and address deployment issues more effectively.

## Deployment Checklist

1. Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
2. Minimal `next.config.js` with only essential features enabled
3. Basic project structure maintained
4. Reduced dependencies and complexity

## Troubleshooting Steps

If deployment continues to fail after these simplifications:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Test with progressively fewer features enabled
4. Consider creating a fresh project and migrating components incrementally

## Next Steps

Once basic deployment is successful:
1. Gradually re-enable features
2. Monitor each deployment for stability
3. Document any specific configuration requirements
4. Establish a reliable CI/CD pipeline
