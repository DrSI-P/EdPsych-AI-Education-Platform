# Text-to-Speech Feature Documentation

This document outlines the implementation of text-to-speech functionality for the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform, providing a comprehensive audio output solution to complement the voice input features.

## Overview

The text-to-speech feature has been designed to provide high-quality speech synthesis capabilities, making content accessible to users with diverse needs, particularly those with visual impairments, reading difficulties, or auditory learning preferences.

## Text-to-Speech Service

The text-to-speech service (`textToSpeech.ts`) provides advanced speech synthesis capabilities with extensive customization options:

1. **Multiple Voice Support**: Access to all system voices with preference options for UK English and child-friendly voices
2. **Special Educational Needs Support**: Specialised processing for simplified language, extended pauses, and keyword emphasis
3. **Multi-language Support**: Speech synthesis in multiple languages, with a focus on UK English
4. **Customizable Speech Parameters**: Adjustable rate, pitch, and volume
5. **Text Highlighting**: Synchronized highlighting of text being read

### Key Features

- **Sentence-by-Sentence Processing**: Breaks text into manageable chunks for better control and highlighting
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time tracking of reading progress
- **Pause and Resume**: Full control over the reading process
- **Special Needs Processing**: 
  - Simplified language for complex terms
  - Extended pauses for better comprehension
  - Keyword emphasis for important concepts

## Text-to-Speech Component

The text-to-speech component (`text-to-speech.tsx`) provides a user-friendly interface for the speech synthesis functionality:

1. **Intuitive Controls**: Simple play, pause, and stop buttons
2. **Visual Feedback**: Progress bar and highlighted text showing current reading position
3. **Customizable Settings**: Comprehensive options for voice, rate, pitch, volume, and language
4. **Special Educational Needs Settings**: Dedicated settings for simplified language, extended pauses, and keyword emphasis
5. **Recommended Settings Profiles**: Suggested configurations for specific needs (reading difficulties, auditory processing, EAL)

## Integration with Accessibility Features

The text-to-speech functionality integrates seamlessly with the platform's accessibility features:

1. **Complementary to Voice Input**: Creates a complete audio interaction system when combined with voice input
2. **Consistent UI Design**: Follows the same design patterns as other accessibility features
3. **Shared Settings**: Coordinates with global accessibility settings
4. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Ensures accessibility for users with diverse needs

## Educational Psychology Alignment

The implementation aligns with key educational psychology principles:

1. **Universal Design for Learning**: Provides alternative means of accessing content
2. **Multi-Sensory Learning**: Engages both visual and auditory channels
3. **Cognitive Load Management**: Reduces reading effort for struggling readers
4. **Personalized Learning**: Customizable to individual needs and preferences
5. **Inclusive Education**: Makes content accessible to users with diverse needs

## Technical Implementation

The features are implemented using:

1. **Web Speech API**: For speech synthesis capabilities
2. **React Hooks**: For state management and side effects
3. **Local Storage**: For persisting user preferences
4. **Text Processing**: For special needs adaptations
5. **UI Components**: For intuitive control and feedback

## Use Cases

The text-to-speech feature supports various educational scenarios:

1. **Reading Support**: Assists users with dyslexia, visual impairments, or reading difficulties
2. **Language Learning**: Provides pronunciation models for language learners
3. **Multitasking**: Allows users to listen to content while engaged in other activities
4. **Proofreading**: Helps users identify errors by hearing content read aloud
5. **Focus and Attention**: Supports users with attention difficulties by providing auditory engagement

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. **Document Reading**: Direct reading of PDF, Word, and other document formats
2. **Advanced Text Processing**: More sophisticated language simplification and keyword identification
3. **Voice Customization**: Additional voice parameters and custom voice creation
4. **Offline Support**: Functionality when internet connection is limited
5. **Integration with Learning Materials**: Automatic reading of platform content

## Conclusion

The text-to-speech feature significantly enhances the platform's accessibility and usability, particularly for users with reading difficulties or auditory learning preferences. When combined with the voice input capabilities, it creates a comprehensive audio interaction system that supports inclusive education and aligns with the platform's educational psychology principles.
