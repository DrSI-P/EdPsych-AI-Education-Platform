### Introduction (0:00-0:30)

Welcome to this demonstration of the Restorative Justice Implementation Tools within EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. Today, I'll show you how our platform supports schools in implementing restorative approaches that strengthen relationships, resolve conflicts constructively, and create more positive learning environments.

### Educational Psychology Foundations (0:30-1:00)

Restorative approaches are grounded in the understanding that behaviour is communication and that relationships are central to effective learning environments. Rather than focusing solely on rules and consequences, restorative practices emphasize:

Understanding the underlying causes of behaviour
Repairing harm and rebuilding relationships
Developing empathy and emotional literacy
Creating communities of mutual respect and support

These principles align with educational psychology research showing that pupils learn best in environments where they feel safe, valued, and connected.

### Guided Restorative Conversation Frameworks (1:00-1:30)

Our platform provides structured frameworks for restorative conversations that can be adapted for different age groups and situations:

For early years and Key Stage 1, simple question sequences with visual supports help young children express feelings and needs.

For Key Stage 2, more detailed frameworks guide pupils through understanding impact and making amends.

For secondary students, sophisticated conversation structures develop deeper reflection and responsibility.

Each framework is designed to be developmentally appropriate while maintaining the core restorative principles of expressing feelings, understanding impact, and finding ways forward.

### Circle Process Templates (1:30-2:00)

Circle processes are powerful tools for building community, addressing concerns, and celebrating successes. Our platform includes:

Check-in and check-out circle templates for daily classroom use
Problem-solving circle structures for addressing group challenges
Celebration circle formats for recognising achievements and growth
Healing circle frameworks for addressing more significant harms

These templates include suggested questions, facilitation guides, and adaptations for different age groups and contexts, making it easy for educators to implement effective circle practices.

### Age-Appropriate Reflection Prompts (2:00-2:15)

Meaningful reflection is central to restorative practise. Our platform provides developmentally appropriate reflection prompts that help pupils:

Identify and express emotions
Understand the impact of their actions on others
Consider alternative choices and their potential outcomes
Develop plans for repairing harm and moving forward

These prompts can be used in individual reflection activities, guided conversations, or written responses, providing flexibility for different learning styles and situations.

### Agreement Tracking System (2:15-2:30)
[Screen transitions to show agreement tracking]

When restorative conversations lead to agreements, our tracking system helps ensure accountability and follow-through:

Digital agreement templates capture commitments from all parties
Reminder systems support pupils in fulfilling their agreements
Check-in schedules help monitor progress and provide support
Celebration mechanisms recognise successful completion

This system transforms agreements from one-time conversations to ongoing processes of growth and relationship building.

### Staff Training and Resources (2:30-2:45)

Implementing restorative approaches requires skill development and cultural change. Our platform includes:

Professional development modules on restorative principles and practices
Simulation activities for practicing facilitation skills
Implementation guides for whole-school approaches
Case studies showcasing successful applications in UK schools

These resources help build staff confidence and competence in applying restorative approaches consistently across the school community.

### Outcome Measurement Tools (2:45-3:00)
[Screen transitions to show measurement tools]

To evaluate the impact of restorative practices, our platform provides:

Climate surveys measuring perceptions of safety, belonging, and respect
Incident tracking that monitors both frequency and resolution methods
Relationship quality assessments for classroom and school communities
Wellbeing indicators that capture social and emotional outcomes

These tools help schools demonstrate the effectiveness of restorative approaches and identify areas for continued growth and development.

### Conclusion (3:00-3:15)
[AI Avatar returns to full screen]

The Restorative Justice Implementation Tools in EdPsych Connect represent our commitment to creating educational environments where relationships are valued, conflicts are viewed as learning opportunities, and all community members feel heard and respected.

By providing structured, developmentally appropriate resources for implementing restorative practices, we help schools move beyond punitive approaches to discipline and create cultures of care, respect, and responsibility.

Thank you for exploring these features with me. If you have questions about implementing restorative approaches in your educational setting, please reach out to our support team.
