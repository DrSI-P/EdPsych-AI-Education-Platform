Welcome to this comprehensive overview of the EdPsych Connect platform. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, and today I'll guide you through the full suite of features that make our platform a revolutionary tool for education. This tour will showcase how we've integrated educational psychology principles with cutting-edge technology to create a truly unique learning ecosystem.

### Platform Architecture Overview (0:30-1:15)
EdPsych Connect is built on a modular architecture that seamlessly integrates multiple components:

Our core infrastructure provides robust authentication, data management, and AI services that power the entire platform. We've implemented role-based access control to ensure appropriate permissions for different users, from pupils to administrators.

The AI service layer integrates multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and others, with fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent service. This powers our advanced capabilities like learning style assessment, emotional pattern recognition, and adaptive content delivery.

All of this is wrapped in an accessible, intuitive user interface designed for users of all ages and abilities, from nursery children to educational professionals.

### Assessment Module (1:15-2:00)

Our assessment module revolutionises how we evaluate learning and gather pupil voice. It supports multiple question types including multiple choice, open-ended, matching, and file upload responses.

What makes our assessment truly special is the AI-powered analysis. The system can automatically grade responses while providing nuanced feedback that goes beyond simple right or wrong answers. For open-ended questions, our AI analyses not just content but reasoning patterns and conceptual understanding.

The pupil voice collection tools allow children and young people to express their thoughts and feelings in ways that are comfortable for them, using multiple modalities including text, audio, and visual inputs.

All assessments align with UK curriculum standards and can be customised for different age groups and learning needs.

### Resource Library (2:00-2:45)

The resource library serves as a comprehensive repository of learning materials that can be easily categorised, searched, and filtered. Resources are tagged with curriculum alignments, making it simple to find materials for specific learning objectives.

Our copyright protection system ensures all materials respect intellectual property rights, while allowing for appropriate educational use.

What sets our resource library apart is how it integrates with other platform components. Resources can be linked directly to curriculum plans, embedded in assessments, or recommended by our AI based on individual learning patterns.

### Curriculum Planning (2:45-3:30)

The curriculum planning module allows educators to create structured learning journeys aligned with UK curriculum standards. Our learning objective management system breaks down complex skills into manageable components that can be tracked and assessed.

The platform provides curriculum templates based on best practices, which can be customised to meet the needs of different learners and contexts.

The curriculum analytics feature provides insights into coverage, pacing, and effectiveness, helping educators make data-informed decisions about their teaching approach.

Our collaboration tools enable teams of educators to work together on curriculum development, sharing expertise and resources to create truly exceptional learning experiences.

### Immersive Learning (3:30-4:15)

Our immersive learning environments leverage WebXR technology to create engaging 3D learning experiences. The platform includes a 3D learning environment editor that allows educators to create custom spaces without requiring technical expertise.

The 3D model library provides ready-to-use assets that can be incorporated into learning environments, while interactive elements enable meaningful engagement with the content.

These immersive experiences are particularly valuable for learners who benefit from visual and spatial approaches, and for concepts that are difficult to demonstrate in traditional formats.

### Special Educational Needs Support (4:15-5:00)

EdPsych Connect excels in supporting learners with special educational needs. Our platform includes comprehensive tools for executive dysfunction support, learning differences accommodation, and sensory regulation.

The emotional pattern recognition system identifies potential concerns and recommends appropriate interventions, while our behaviour tracking tools focus on positive reinforcement and skill development.

For educators and professionals, we provide IEP/504 plan management tools that streamline documentation while ensuring appropriate support is in place.

All of these features are designed with input from educational psychologists and SEN specialists to ensure they reflect best practices and evidence-based approaches.

### Voice Input and Accessibility (5:00-5:30)

Accessibility is at the core of EdPsych Connect. Our platform includes advanced speech recognition optimised for children's voices, allowing learners who struggle with typing to fully participate.

The voice-to-text functionality works across all assignment types, while our voice navigation system enables hands-free operation of the platform.

For output, our high-quality text-to-speech converts written content to spoken word, supporting learners with reading difficulties.

These features, combined with our simplified interface options and customisable visual settings, ensure that all learners can access and benefit from the platform regardless of their individual needs.

### Analytics and Reporting (5:30-6:00)

Our analytics and reporting system provides deep insights into learning processes and outcomes. For students, we track progress across multiple dimensions, identifying strengths and areas for growth.

For educators, we provide performance analytics that highlight effective teaching strategies and areas where additional support might be beneficial.

Our predictive analytics can identify potential challenges before they become significant issues, allowing for proactive intervention.

All of this data is presented through intuitive visualisations that make complex information accessible and actionable.

### Integration and Extension (6:00-6:30)
