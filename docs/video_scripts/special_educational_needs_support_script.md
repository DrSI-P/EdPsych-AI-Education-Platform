Welcome to this demonstration of the Special Educational Needs Support Tools within EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. Today, I'll show you how our platform provides comprehensive, evidence-based support for learners with diverse needs, empowering them to access the curriculum and develop essential skills for success.

### Educational Psychology Foundations (0:30-1:00)

Our approach to supporting special educational needs is grounded in educational psychology principles and evidence-based practise. We recognise that every learner is unique, with individual strengths, challenges, and learning profiles that require personalized support.

Rather than focusing solely on accommodations, our tools are designed to develop skills and strategies that promote independence and self-efficacy. This approach aligns with research showing that the most effective interventions combine appropriate support with opportunities to build capacity over time.

### Executive Function Support (1:00-1:30)

Executive function challenges affect many learners, impacting organisation, planning, time management, and emotional regulation. Our platform includes specialised tools to develop these crucial skills:

Visual schedules and task breakdowns help learners understand and manage complex assignments.

Digital planners with customizable reminders support time management and task completion.

Guided reflection tools help pupils identify effective strategies and apply them to new situations.

These supports can be gradually adjusted as learners develop greater independence, providing scaffolding without creating dependency.

### Learning Differences Accommodation (1:30-2:00)

For pupils with specific learning differences like dyslexia, dyscalculia, or dysgraphia, our platform provides targeted support:

Text-to-speech and speech-to-text tools remove barriers to accessing and producing written content.

Customizable visual displays adjust font, spacing, colour, and layout to optimise readability.

Multi-modal content presentation allows information to be accessed through preferred learning channels.

Mathematical supports include visual models, step-by-step guides, and alternative calculation methods.

### Sensory and Emotional Regulation (2:00-2:30)

Many learners benefit from support with sensory processing and emotional regulation:

Our sensory regulation tools help pupils identify their sensory needs and access appropriate strategies.

The emotional pattern recognition system identifies potential triggers and provides personalized regulation techniques.

Guided mindfulness activities offer in-the-moment support for managing overwhelming emotions.

Visual supports help pupils identify, express, and manage their emotional states effectively.

### Data-Informed Support (2:30-3:00)

The Special Educational Needs Support Tools in EdPsych Connect represent our commitment to inclusive education. By providing comprehensive, evidence-based support that develops skills and promotes independence, we help ensure that all learners can access the curriculum and achieve their potential.

These tools embody our belief that technology should adapt to learners' needs, not the other way around. The result is a more equitable, engaging, and effective learning experience for every child, regardless of their individual challenges or learning differences.
