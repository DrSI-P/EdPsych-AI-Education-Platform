[AI Avatar appears with professional yet approachable demeanor]

Hello and welcome to EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, and I'm here to introduce you to this learning platform that's been designed specifically to support your educational journey. Unlike standard learning systems, EdPsych Connect adapts to how you learn best and gives you more control over your educational experience.

### Logging In and Security (0:20-0:40)

Getting started is straightforward. Your school will provide you with login details. For security, we recommend creating a strong password and, if you're comfortable with it, setting up the optional two-factor authentication for additional account protection.

Your privacy matters to us. Everything you do on the platform is secure, and you control who can see your work and progress. Let's look at your dashboard now.

### Dashboard Overview (0:40-1:00)

This is your personalised dashboard. It shows your current subjects, upcoming assignments, recent feedback, and your progress across different areas. You can customise this view to prioritise what matters most to you.

The navigation menu on the left gives you access to all platform features, and the quick actions bar at the top lets you jump straight to common tasks like submitting work or checking messages.

### Learning Resources and Activities (1:00-1:30)

EdPsych Connect provides access to a wide range of learning resources tailored to your courses and learning preferences. These include interactive lessons, videos, practise exercises, and extension materials.

What makes this platform unique is how it adapts to your learning style. As you use the system, it identifies whether you learn better through visual materials, reading, interactive exercises, or other approaches, and adjusts accordingly.

You can also manually set your preferences if you already know what works best for you.

### Assessment and Feedback (1:30-2:00)

The assessment section is where you'll find assignments, quizzes, and tests. You can submit work in multiple formats – text, audio, video, or file uploads – giving you flexibility in how you demonstrate your understanding.

Feedback is provided through the same system, with clear guidance on your strengths and specific areas for improvement. The progress tracking tools help you visualise your development over time, focusing on growth rather than just grades.

### Voice and Accessibility Features (2:00-2:20)

EdPsych Connect includes several features to make learning more accessible. The voice input option allows you to dictate responses rather than typing them. This is particularly useful for longer assignments or if you find typing challenging.

You can also customise the visual display with different colour schemes, font sizes, and layouts to suit your preferences. The text-to-speech function can read content aloud if you prefer to listen rather than read.

### Collaboration Tools (2:20-2:40)

Learning often works best when we collaborate. The platform includes tools for group projects, peer feedback, and discussion forums. You can share resources, work together on documents, and communicate with classmates within a secure environment.

These tools are designed to help you develop teamwork and communication skills while ensuring everyone can contribute effectively.

### Getting Help (2:40-3:00)

If you need assistance at any point, there are several options available:

The help centre contains guides and tutorials for all platform features.
The AI assistant can answer common questions instantly.
The message system lets you contact your teachers directly.
The technical support team is available for any system-related issues.

Remember, asking for help when you need it is an important part of effective learning.

### Conclusion (3:00-3:20)
[AI Avatar smiles encouragingly]

EdPsych Connect is designed to support your individual learning journey, helping you develop not just academic knowledge but also the skills you'll need for future success.

As you use the platform, it will become increasingly personalised to your needs and preferences. Your feedback is valuable in this process, so don't hesitate to let us know what works well for you and what could be improved.

I wish you success in your learning journey. Remember, education is about progress, not perfection, and EdPsych Connect is here to support you every step of the way.
