Welcome to this training session on assessment and feedback strategies within EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. Today, I'll guide you through our comprehensive assessment and feedback tools that help you gather meaningful insights about pupil learning and provide feedback that drives progress. These features are designed to transform assessment from a measurement exercise into a powerful learning opportunity.

### Assessment Philosophy (0:30-1:00)

EdPsych Connect's assessment approach is built on three core principles:

First, assessment should primarily serve learning, not just measurement. Every assessment opportunity should yield actionable insights that inform teaching and support pupil progress.

Second, assessment should be varied and authentic, capturing the full range of knowledge, skills, and understanding that we value.

Third, feedback should be specific, timely, and forward-looking, helping pupils understand not just where they are, but how to improve.

These principles inform all the assessment and feedback tools within the platform.

### Formative Assessment Tools (1:00-1:45)

The formative assessment features help you gather ongoing insights about pupil understanding:

The quick check tools provide instant feedback during lessons through polls, quizzes, and digital exit tickets.

The misconception detector identifies common errors and misunderstandings in real-time.

The confidence rating system allows pupils to indicate their perceived mastery, helping identify discrepancies between confidence and performance.

The visual learning trackers show progress patterns that might not be apparent in numerical data alone.

These tools help you make informed instructional decisions based on current pupil understanding rather than assumptions.

### Authentic Assessment Design (1:45-2:30)

The authentic assessment features help you create meaningful evaluation experiences:

The performance task designer helps create real-world scenarios that require application of knowledge and skills.

The project-based assessment tools support extended learning experiences with embedded evaluation points.

The multimodal response options allow pupils to demonstrate understanding through text, audio, video, or visual formats.

The portfolio system enables collection and curation of work samples that show development over time.

These approaches help pupils see the relevance of their learning while developing transferable skills alongside subject knowledge.

### Feedback Strategies (2:30-3:15)

The feedback tools help you provide guidance that moves learning forward:

The comment bank contains customizable, subject-specific feedback statements that you can adapt and personalize.

The audio feedback recorder allows you to provide nuanced guidance through voice rather than text alone.

The feedback effectiveness analyzer helps identify patterns in your comments and suggests enhancements.

The guided self-assessment tools help pupils evaluate their own work against clear criteria before receiving teacher feedback.

The action planning system helps pupils translate feedback into specific next steps.

These features help ensure that your feedback leads to action and improvement rather than simply justifying a mark.

### Summative Assessment and Reporting (3:15-3:45)

For summative assessment, EdPsych Connect offers sophisticated tools:

The standards-based grading system allows detailed tracking of achievement against specific learning objectives.

The comparative judgment engine facilitates reliable assessment of complex work through paired comparisons.

The moderation tools support consistent evaluation across multiple teachers.

The customizable report generator creates detailed, accessible summaries of pupil achievement for different audiences.

These tools help ensure that summative assessments provide meaningful information about pupil achievement while maintaining appropriate rigor.

### Assessment Analytics (3:45-4:15)

The assessment analytics provide valuable insights about both pupil learning and assessment quality:

The item analysis shows which questions or tasks are most effective at revealing pupil understanding.

The progress patterns highlight growth trajectories across different pupil groups and subject areas.

The feedback impact metrics show how different types of feedback influence subsequent performance.

The assessment equity analyzer helps identify and address potential bias in assessment practices.

These analytics help you continuously refine your assessment approach based on evidence of what works.

### Conclusion (4:15-4:30)
