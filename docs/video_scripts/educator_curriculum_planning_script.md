Welcome to this training session on the curriculum planning tools within EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. Today, I'll guide you through our comprehensive curriculum design features that help you create coherent, engaging, and effective learning journeys for your pupils. These tools combine educational psychology principles with practical planning capabilities to transform curriculum development.

### Curriculum Mapping Overview (0:30-1:15)

The curriculum mapping system provides a visual representation of your entire curriculum:

The learning progression maps show how concepts and skills develop across year groups and key stages.

The interdisciplinary connection tools highlight relationships between different subject areas, supporting cross-curricular planning.

The curriculum coverage analyzer ensures comprehensive alignment with national curriculum requirements while identifying potential gaps.

The prerequisite relationship mapper shows dependencies between different skills and knowledge areas, helping ensure pupils have necessary foundations before encountering new concepts.

These tools help you develop a coherent curriculum that builds systematically while making meaningful connections across subjects.

### Unit Planning Tools (1:15-2:00)

The unit planning features support detailed design of learning sequences:

The backward design framework guides you through establishing learning outcomes, assessment evidence, and learning experiences.

The engagement optimization tool suggests hooks, real-world connections, and pupil-centred activities to increase motivation.

The differentiation planner helps you build in appropriate challenge and support for diverse learners from the outset.

The resource curator recommends high-quality materials aligned with your learning objectives and pupil needs.

These tools help you create units that are purposeful, engaging, and accessible to all learners.

### Lesson Sequence Builder (2:00-2:45)

The lesson sequence builder helps you develop effective learning progressions:

The cognitive load analyzer ensures new content is introduced at an appropriate pace and complexity.

The spaced repetition scheduler builds in strategic review of previously taught content to strengthen retention.

The formative checkpoint planner integrates regular opportunities to assess understanding and adjust instruction.

The learning modality balancer ensures lessons incorporate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements to support different learning preferences.

These features help you create lesson sequences that align with how the brain learns most effectively.

### Assessment Integration (2:45-3:15)

The assessment planning tools ensure tight alignment between curriculum and evaluation:

The assessment design wizard helps create varied assessments that measure the full range of learning objectives.

The rubric generator builds detailed, standards-aligned evaluation frameworks with exemplars.

The assessment calendar ensures appropriate distribution and variety of assessment methods.

The feedback planning tools help you prepare specific, actionable guidance for common misconceptions.

These tools ensure that assessment is fully integrated into your curriculum planning rather than added as an afterthought.

### Collaborative Planning Features (3:15-3:45)

EdPsych Connect supports collaborative curriculum development:

The co-planning workspace allows multiple teachers to work simultaneously on curriculum documents.

The comment and suggestion system facilitates asynchronous feedback and refinement.

The version control features track changes and allow comparison of different curriculum iterations.

The role-based permissions ensure appropriate access for department heads, subject coordinators, and individual teachers.

These collaborative tools help build consistency across classrooms while leveraging the expertise of your entire team.

### Curriculum Analytics (3:45-4:15)

Once implemented, the curriculum analytics provide valuable insights:

The engagement metrics show which units and lessons generate the highest pupil interest and participation.

The mastery patterns reveal which curriculum elements lead to strongest learning outcomes.

The pacing analysis helps optimise the time allocation for different topics and skills.

The impact comparison allows you to evaluate curriculum changes against previous versions.

These analytics help you continuously refine your curriculum based on evidence rather than assumption.

### Conclusion (4:15-4:30)
