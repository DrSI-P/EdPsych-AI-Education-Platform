Hello and welcome to EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. This video is designed specifically for parents and carers who want to support their child's educational journey. I'll guide you through setting up your account and show you how our platform can help you engage meaningfully with your child's learning and development.

### Account Setup and Navigation (0:30-1:00)

Let's begin with setting up your account. You should have received an invitation email from your child's school with login instructions. After setting your password, you'll arrive at your parent dashboard.

The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and straightforward. You'll see sections for your child's progress, upcoming activities, school communications, and resources for home learning. The navigation is consistent throughout the platform, making it easy to find what you need.

### Child Profile and Progress (1:00-1:30)

From your dashboard, you can access your child's profile. Here you'll find:
- Current learning objectives and progress
- Recent assessments and achievements
- Teacher observations and feedback
- Areas of strength and development opportunities

This information is presented in clear, jargon-free language, focusing on what your child can do and how you can support their next steps.

### Communication Tools (1:30-2:00)

EdPsych Connect makes it easy to stay in touch with your child's teachers. The messaging system allows for direct communication while respecting teachers' working hours.

The translation feature is particularly helpful for families where English isn't the first language, automatically translating messages in both directions.

You can also schedule virtual meetings, view upcoming school events, and receive important announcements all in one place.

### Supporting Learning at Home (2:00-2:45)

One of the most valuable aspects of EdPsych Connect is the home learning support. Based on your child's current learning objectives and interests, the platform suggests activities you can do together at home.

These aren't just more worksheets – they're engaging, practical activities that fit into family life and reinforce classroom learning in meaningful ways.

The resource library includes guides on supporting different aspects of learning, from reading and mathematics to emotional wellbeing and resilience.

For children with specific learning needs, you'll find tailored strategies and approaches recommended by educational psychology research.

### Understanding Your Child's Learning (2:45-3:15)

EdPsych Connect helps you understand how your child learns best. The learning profile shows their preferences, strengths, and areas where they might need additional support.

This information is presented without labels or jargon, focusing instead on practical ways you can support their individual learning style.

The progress tracking shows development over time, celebrating growth and highlighting consistent patterns rather than focusing solely on academic achievement.

### Accessibility and Preferences (3:15-3:30)

You can customize your EdPsych Connect experience through the settings menu. Adjust text size, contrast, and language preferences to suit your needs.

If you're supporting a child with specific requirements, you can also enable additional accessibility features that will carry over to their account when they log in.

### Getting Help (3:30-3:45)

[AI Avatar smiles warmly]

Your involvement in your child's education makes a tremendous difference to their success and wellbeing. EdPsych Connect is designed to make that involvement easier, more meaningful, and more effective.

Remember, you don't need to be an expert in education to support your child's learning – you're already an expert on your child. EdPsych Connect simply provides the tools and insights to help you apply that expertise in supporting their educational journey.

Thank you for partnering with us in your child's education. Together, we can create a supportive, engaging learning experience that helps them thrive.
