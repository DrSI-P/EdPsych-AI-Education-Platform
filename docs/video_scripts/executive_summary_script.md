Welcome to EdPsych Connect, where educational psychology meets cutting-edge technology to transform how we support children and young people in their learning journey. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist with over 12 years of experience working with children, young people, and educational institutions across the UK.

EdPsych Connect was born from a simple yet powerful vision: to create personalised, evidence-based learning experiences that empower every child, regardless of their starting point or individual needs.

### Platform Overview (0:30-1:00)
EdPsech Connect Limited brings together three interconnected components:

Second, Future Voices Academy, our educational initiative focused on developing the next generation of educational leaders through evidence-based training and mentorship.

And third, Voices of the Future, our media initiative amplifying the perspectives of children and young people in educational discourse.
