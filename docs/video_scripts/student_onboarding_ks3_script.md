Hello and welcome to EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, and I'm here to show you how this platform will support your learning journey throughout Key Stage 3. EdPsych Connect isn't just another learning website – it's a personalised system designed to adapt to how you learn best and help you develop important skills for the future.

### Logging In and Security (0:20-0:40)

Your school will provide you with your login details. It's important to create a strong password that you don't share with others. Your EdPsych Connect account is your personal learning space, and everything you do here is secure and private.

Once you're logged in, you'll see your personalised dashboard. Let's take a look at what you'll find there.

### Dashboard Overview (0:40-1:00)

This is your dashboard – your central hub for all your learning activities. You can see your subjects, upcoming assignments, recent feedback, and your progress across different areas.

The navigation menu on the left gives you access to all the different parts of the platform. The notifications area at the top right will alert you to new assignments, feedback, or messages from your teachers.

### Learning Resources and Activities (1:00-1:30)

When you click on a subject, you'll find all your learning materials organised into units and lessons. These include interactive activities, videos, reading materials, and practice exercises.

What makes EdPsych Connect special is that it learns how you learn best. As you use the platform, it will begin to present information in ways that work better for you – whether that's through visual materials, interactive exercises, or other approaches.

You can also set your own learning preferences in your profile settings if you already know what works best for you.

### Assignments and Feedback (1:30-2:00)

The assignments section is where you'll find your homework, projects, and assessments. You can submit your work in different formats – you can type your answers, record audio or video responses, or upload files.

After your teacher reviews your work, you'll receive feedback here too. The feedback isn't just about marks – it includes specific comments about what you did well and suggestions for improvement.

The progress tracker helps you see how you're developing in different skills and knowledge areas over time.

### Voice and Accessibility Features (2:00-2:20)

EdPsych Connect includes several features to make learning easier and more accessible. The voice input button lets you speak your answers instead of typing them – this is great for longer responses or if you find typing difficult.

You can also customise how the platform looks by changing colours, font sizes, and layouts to suit your preferences. The text-to-speech function can read content aloud to you if you prefer listening to reading.

### Study Tools and Organisation (2:20-2:40)

As you progress through Key Stage 3, organisation becomes increasingly important. EdPsych Connect includes tools to help you manage your learning:

The calendar shows all your upcoming deadlines and events.
The study planner helps you break down big projects into manageable steps.
The revision tools help you prepare for assessments effectively.
The note-taking system lets you save important information in one place.

These tools will help you develop good study habits that will be valuable throughout your education.

### Getting Help (2:40-3:00)

The help button provides guides for using all platform features.
The message system lets you contact your teachers with questions.
The AI assistant can answer common questions instantly.
The technical support option is available if something isn't working correctly.

Remember, asking for help when you need it is an important skill, not a weakness.
