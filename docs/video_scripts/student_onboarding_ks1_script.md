When you want to visit EdPsych Connect, your teacher will give you a special card with your name and picture on it. You'll see this friendly door on the screen. Just tap your card on the special spot, and the door will open to your very own learning world!

If you're using a tablet or computer at home, your grown-up will help you type in your special code to open the door.

Can you see your name at the top? And look at your avatar - that's the little character that represents you. You can change how it looks by tapping on it.

These big colorful tiles show your learning journeys. Each one is a different adventure waiting for you!

When you tap on a learning journey, you'll see lots of exciting activities. Some might be stories to read, some might be games to play, and others might be puzzles to solve.

The best thing about EdPsych Connect is that it gets to know what you like and how you learn best. If you're really good at something, it might give you more challenging activities. If something is tricky, it will give you extra help until you feel confident.

Let's try tapping on this "Space Adventure" journey to see what's inside!

### Voice Features (1:30-1:50)

Sometimes instead of tapping or typing, you can talk to EdPsych Connect! If you see this microphone button, you can tap it and then say your answer out loud. The computer will listen to you and understand what you're saying. Isn't that amazing?

You can also tap this speaker button if you want the computer to read something to you. This is really helpful if you're still learning to read or if you just prefer listening.

### Stars and Rewards (1:50-2:10)
[Screen transitions to show rewards system]

As you complete activities and learn new things, you'll earn special stars and badges. These show all the progress you're making and the new skills you're learning.

When you collect enough stars, you can unlock special rewards like new games or fun activities. You can see all your stars and badges by tapping on this treasure chest.

Remember, the most important thing isn't how many stars you get, but how much you're learning and growing!

### Getting Help (2:10-2:30)

And remember, you can always ask your teacher or grown-up for help if you need it.
