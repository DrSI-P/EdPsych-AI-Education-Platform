Let's begin with the advanced analytics dashboard. Beyond basic progress tracking, this tool provides sophisticated insights into learning patterns:

The cognitive load analyzer identifies content that may be overwhelming pupils, allowing you to adjust complexity or provide additional scaffolding.

The engagement patterns tool reveals when and how different pupils interact with content, helping you optimise lesson timing and format.

The concept mastery mapper shows connections between related skills and knowledge areas, highlighting prerequisite gaps that may be hindering progress.

The comparative progress tool allows you to view individual pupil development against anonymized benchmarks while maintaining appropriate privacy.

These insights enable truly personalized teaching interventions based on objective data rather than assumptions.

### Custom Content Creation (1:15-2:00)

The advanced content creation suite allows you to develop bespoke learning materials:

The interactive lesson builder includes branching scenarios, embedded assessments, and multimedia integration.

The differentiation engine automatically creates multiple versions of content at different complexity levels while maintaining core learning objectives.

The accessibility checker ensures all materials meet WCAG standards and are usable by all pupils.

The content effectiveness tracker provides data on how pupils engage with your custom materials, allowing for continuous refinement.

These tools enable you to create precisely targeted resources that align with your teaching approach and pupil needs.
