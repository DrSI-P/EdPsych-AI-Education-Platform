### Introduction (0:00-0:30)

Welcome to this demonstration of the Student Voice Amplification System within EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. Today, I'll show you how our platform empowers children and young people to express their thoughts, ideas, and concerns in meaningful ways that influence their educational experience.

### Educational Psychology Foundations (0:30-1:00)

The Student Voice Amplification System is built on the educational psychology principle that children and young people are active participants in their own learning, not passive recipients. Research consistently shows that when pupils feel their voices are heard and valued, they develop greater agency, engagement, and ownership of their educational journey.

This system embodies Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which establishes the right of children to express their views freely in matters affecting them. By creating structured, accessible channels for pupil voice, we help schools honour this right while benefiting from the unique insights that only learners themselves can provide.

### Multi-Modal Feedback Collection (1:00-1:30)

Our platform offers multiple ways for pupils to share their thoughts and experiences:

Text-based responses allow for traditional written feedback.
Audio recording enables pupils to speak their thoughts naturally.
Visual tools like emoji reactions and drawing provide alternative expression methods.
Video responses capture nuanced communication including tone and body language.

These options ensure that all pupils, regardless of age, language proficiency, or communication preferences, can express themselves effectively.

### Anonymous Suggestion System (1:30-1:45)

The anonymous suggestion system creates a safe space for pupils to share concerns or ideas they might be hesitant to express directly. This feature is particularly valuable for sensitive topics or in contexts where pupils may fear judgment.

Robust safeguarding measures ensure that while anonymity is preserved, any disclosures indicating safety concerns are appropriately flagged for staff attention.

### Student-Led Conference Tools (1:45-2:00)

Our student-led conference tools transform traditional parent-teacher meetings by placing pupils at the centre of the conversation. Pupils can:

Curate portfolios of their work to showcase progress
Prepare talking points about achievements and challenges
Set the agenda for discussions about their learning
Document agreed-upon next steps and support strategies

This approach develops metacognitive skills while ensuring that educational discussions remain focused on the learner's perspective and needs.

### Collaborative Goal Setting (2:00-2:15)

The collaborative goal setting interface enables pupils to participate actively in determining their learning objectives. Rather than having goals imposed upon them, learners work with educators to:

Identify meaningful areas for growth
Establish realistic timelines and success criteria
Select preferred strategies and resources
Track progress and celebrate achievements

This collaborative approach increases motivation and commitment while teaching valuable self-regulation skills.

### Impact Visualisation (2:15-2:30)

One of the most powerful aspects of our Student Voice Amplification System is the impact visualisation feature. This shows pupils how their input has influenced decisions and changes within their educational environment.

By closing the feedback loop, we demonstrate to children and young people that their voices truly matter, encouraging continued engagement and developing their sense of efficacy and citizenship.

### Implementation Strategies (2:30-2:45)
[Screen transitions to show implementation examples]

Successful implementation of student voice initiatives requires thoughtful planning and integration. Our platform provides:

Age-appropriate frameworks for different key stages
Guidance for educators on facilitating meaningful participation
Strategies for balancing pupil voice with curriculum requirements
Examples of best practise from schools across the UK

These resources help ensure that student voice becomes an integral part of school culture rather than an occasional add-on.

### Conclusion (2:45-3:00)
[AI Avatar returns to full screen]

The Student Voice Amplification System represents our commitment to recognising children and young people as experts in their own experience. By creating structured, accessible channels for pupil voice, we help schools develop more responsive, inclusive, and effective learning environments.

This approach benefits not only the pupils themselves, who develop agency and self-advocacy skills, but also educators, who gain valuable insights that can inform and improve their practise.

Thank you for exploring this feature with me. If you have questions about implementing student voice initiatives in your educational setting, please reach out to our support team.
