This video is designed for parents who have mastered the basics of the platform and are ready to explore more advanced features.

Let's begin with the advanced learning insights dashboard. This provides a deeper understanding of your child's educational development:

The learning patterns analyzer shows how your child engages with different types of content and activities, revealing their natural learning preferences.

The strengths and challenges map highlights areas where your child excels and where they might benefit from additional support.

The progress timeline shows development over longer periods, helping you see growth that might not be apparent day-to-day.

The comparison tools show your child's progress relative to curriculum expectations while maintaining appropriate privacy.

These insights help you have more informed conversations with your child and their teachers about their educational journey.

### Supporting Home Learning (1:15-2:00)
