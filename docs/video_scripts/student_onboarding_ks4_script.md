Hello and welcome to EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, and I'm here to introduce you to this platform that will support your learning throughout Key Stage 4 and your GCSE preparations. EdPsych Connect is designed to help you take greater ownership of your learning journey while providing the structure and resources you need to succeed.

Your school will provide your login credentials. I recommend setting up two-factor authentication for additional security, especially as you'll be storing important coursework and revision materials here.

Your EdPsych Connect account is your personal academic workspace. Everything you do here is secure, and you control who can access your work and progress data.

### Dashboard Overview (0:40-1:00)

This is your personalised dashboard. It provides an overview of your GCSE subjects, upcoming deadlines, recent feedback, and your progress across different assessment objectives.

You can customise this view to prioritise what matters most to you. The quick navigation panel gives you immediate access to your most-used features, and you can configure this based on your preferences.

### Subject Resources and Specification Mapping (1:00-1:30)
