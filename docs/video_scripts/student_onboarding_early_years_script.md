Hello there! I'm Dr. Scott, but you can call me Dr. Scott! I'm so happy to meet you! Today I'm going to show you a special place called EdPsych Connect where we can learn and play together.

When you want to visit EdPsych Connect, your teacher or grown-up will help you get started. You'll see this special door with your very own picture next to it. When you tap on your picture, it opens up to a magical learning world made just for you!

### Dashboard Tour (0:40-1:00)

Look at this colorful page! This is your very own special place. Can you see the big friendly animals? Each animal is holding something exciting for you to try.

The elephant has stories for us to read together.
The lion has counting games to play.
The giraffe has drawing and making activities.
The monkey has songs and rhymes to sing along with.

### Learning Activities (1:00-1:20)

When you tap on an animal friend, they'll show you something fun to do. Sometimes you might listen to a story, sometimes you might count things, and sometimes you might draw or make sounds.

If something feels a bit tricky, that's okay! You can always ask for help by tapping this friendly star, and it will give you some extra help.

### Voice Features (1:20-1:40)

Sometimes instead of tapping buttons, you can talk to EdPsych Connect! If you see this microphone, you can tap it and then say your answer out loud. Isn't that clever?

And if you want to hear something again, you can tap this ear button, and it will speak to you. Let's try it now!

### Getting Help (1:40-2:00)

If you ever need help, you can always ask your teacher or grown-up. Or you can tap on this friendly helper star, and it will show you what to do next.

Remember, in EdPsych Connect, we learn by playing and trying new things. It's okay if something feels tricky at first - that's how our brains grow stronger!

### Conclusion (2:00-2:20)
[AI Avatar smiles warmly with animated stars and animals]

I'm so excited for all the fun we're going to have learning together in EdPsych Connect! Every time you visit, there will be new things to discover and try.

Now, let's go on our learning adventure! Are you ready? Let's go!
