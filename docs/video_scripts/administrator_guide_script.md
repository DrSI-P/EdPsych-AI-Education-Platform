### Account Management and User Roles (0:30-1:15)

Let's begin with account management and user roles. EdPsych Connect uses a role-based access control system that allows precise permission management:

The Super Administrator role has complete system access and is typically assigned to your IT lead or digital strategy leader.

The School Administrator role can manage users, configure school-specific settings, and access analytics, but cannot modify core system configurations.

The Department Head role can manage users and settings within specific subject areas or year groups.

The Educator role has access to teaching tools and pupil data relevant to their assigned classes.

The Support Staff role provides limited access tailored to teaching assistants and other support personnel.

The system also includes specialised roles for Educational Psychologists, SENCOs, and other professionals with specific access requirements.

### User Provisioning and Integration (1:15-1:45)

Bulk import via CSV allows you to quickly set up multiple users from your existing MIS data.

SIMS, Arbor, and Bromcom integrations enable automatic synchronization with your school management system.

Single Sign-On options include Microsoft Azure AD, Google Workspace, and ClassLink, simplifying access for users.

The manual creation workflow allows for adding individual users with customised permissions when needed.
