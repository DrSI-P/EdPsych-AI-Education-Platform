Hello and welcome to EdPsych Connect. I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, and I'm delighted to guide you through getting started with our platform. As an educator myself, I understand the challenges you face in meeting the diverse needs of your pupils while managing your workload. This video will show you how EdPsych Connect can support your teaching practise through evidence-based tools designed specifically for UK educational settings.

### Account Setup and Navigation (0:30-1:15)

Let's begin with setting up your account and navigating the platform. Once your school administrator has created your account, you'll receive an email with login instructions. After setting your password, you'll arrive at your personalised educator dashboard.

The dashboard is organised into key areas: Curriculum Planning, Assessment, Resources, Pupil Profiles, and Professional Development. The navigation bar at the top remains consistent throughout the platform, allowing you to quickly move between sections.

Notice the quick access panel on the right showing your upcoming activities, recent pupil interactions, and notifications. You can customise this panel to display the information most relevant to your role.

The search function at the top allows you to quickly find specific pupils, resources, or curriculum elements without navigating through multiple screens.

### Profile and Preferences (1:15-1:45)

Let's set up your profile and preferences. Click on your name in the top right corner to access your profile settings. Here you can:
- Update your professional information
- Set your teaching specialties and year groups
- Configure notification preferences
- Adjust accessibility settings
- Connect with your school's MIS system

I recommend taking a few minutes to complete your profile, as this helps the platform personalise recommendations and resources to your specific teaching context.

### Class Setup (1:45-2:30)

Now, let's set up your classes. Navigate to the "My Classes" section from your dashboard. You can either import class lists from your school's MIS system or create classes manually.

For each class, you can:
- Add pupils individually or in groups
- Assign co-teachers or teaching assistants
- Set curriculum objectives
- Establish baseline assessments
- Create learning groups within the class

Once your classes are set up, you'll be able to track progress, assign work, and generate reports at both individual and group levels.

### Basic Features Tour (2:30-3:30)

Let's explore some key features you'll use regularly:

The Resource Library contains thousands of curriculum-aligned materials that you can assign directly to pupils or use in your lesson planning. You can filter by subject, key stage, and specific learning objectives.

The Assessment Creator allows you to build custom assessments or use pre-made templates. Our AI-powered analysis provides insights beyond simple scoring, helping you understand conceptual understanding and learning patterns.

The Curriculum Planner helps you map out learning journeys aligned with the National Curriculum, ensuring comprehensive coverage while allowing for personalisation.

The Pupil Voice tools enable you to gather feedback and insights from your pupils in age-appropriate ways, supporting both academic progress and wellbeing.

### AI-Enhanced Teaching Tools (3:30-4:15)

EdPsych Connect includes several AI-enhanced tools to support your teaching:

The Learning Style Analyser helps identify how individual pupils best engage with content, allowing you to differentiate more effectively.

The Content Transformation Engine can adapt materials to different reading levels, learning styles, or specific needs without changing the core learning objectives.

The Automated Documentation tool can generate reports, learning summaries, and parent communications based on pupil activities and assessments, saving you valuable time.

The Contextual Recommendation Engine suggests resources and activities based on curriculum objectives and pupil performance data.

### Getting Help (4:15-4:45)
