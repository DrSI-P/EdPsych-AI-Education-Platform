# Vercel Deployment Error Analysis

This document provides a structured approach to analyzing and resolving common Vercel deployment errors for the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform.

## Common Error Categories

### 1. Build Process Failures

#### Symptoms
- Build fails during the deployment process
- Error messages related to webpack, babel, or other build tools

#### Potential Causes
- **Node.js Version Incompatibility**
  - Project using features not supported by Vercel's Node.js version
  - Dependencies requiring different Node.js version than specified

- **Dependency Resolution Issues**
  - Missing dependencies in package.json
  - Conflicting dependency versions
  - Peer dependency warnings escalated to errors

- **Build Script Errors**
  - Invalid commands in build script
  - Syntax errors in configuration files
  - Resource limitations (memory/time) during build

#### Resolution Steps
1. Check Node.js version compatibility in package.json
2. Review dependency tree for conflicts using `npm ls`
3. Simplify build process and remove unnecessary steps
4. Ensure all required dependencies are properly installed

### 2. Environment Configuration Issues

#### Symptoms
- Build succeeds but runtime errors occur
- References to undefined environment variables
- Authentication or API connection failures

#### Potential Causes
- **Missing Environment Variables**
  - Required variables not set in Vercel dashboard
  - Variables set with incorrect names or values

- **Environment Variable Scope**
  - Server-side variables accessed in client-side code
  - Client-side variables not prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_

- **Secret Management**
  - Secrets exposed in client-side code
  - Incorrect handling of sensitive information

#### Resolution Steps
1. Verify all required environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure client-side variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
3. Check for proper variable access patterns in code
4. Use Vercel's secret management for sensitive information

### 3. Serverless Function Issues

#### Symptoms
- API routes return 500 errors
- Functions timeout or fail to execute
- Size limit exceeded warnings

#### Potential Causes
- **Function Size Limitations**
  - Functions exceeding Vercel's size limits
  - Large dependencies included in function bundles

- **Execution Timeouts**
  - Long-running operations in serverless functions
  - Inefficient database queries or API calls

- **Memory Limitations**
  - Functions exceeding memory allocation
  - Memory leaks in long-running operations

#### Resolution Steps
1. Optimize function size by code splitting and tree shaking
2. Move large dependencies to external services when possible
3. Implement efficient database queries and API calls
4. Use edge functions for performance-critical operations

### 4. Static Asset Issues

#### Symptoms
- Missing images or other static assets
- 404 errors for static files
- Incorrect paths to resources

#### Potential Causes
- **Asset Path Configuration**
  - Incorrect paths to static assets
  - Missing public directory configuration

- **Large Asset Files**
  - Assets exceeding size limits
  - Unoptimized images or other media

- **MIME Type Issues**
  - Incorrect content types for static assets
  - Missing file extensions

#### Resolution Steps
1. Verify static assets are in the correct location (public directory)
2. Use relative paths or the Next.js Image component
3. Optimize large assets (compress images, minify JS/CSS)
4. Ensure proper file extensions and MIME types

## Systematic Troubleshooting Approach

### 1. Isolate the Issue

- Deploy minimal test pages to identify problematic components
- Progressively add features to determine breaking points
- Use feature flags to selectively enable functionality

### 2. Analyze Build Logs

- Review Vercel build logs for specific error messages
- Look for warnings that might escalate to errors
- Check for resource utilization (memory, build time)

### 3. Local Verification

- Test build process locally with `next build`
- Use Vercel CLI for local deployment testing
- Compare local and Vercel environments for discrepancies

### 4. Incremental Resolution

- Address one issue at a time
- Verify each fix with a new deployment
- Document successful resolution patterns

## Next Steps After Error Identification

Once specific errors are identified from the Vercel build logs, this document will be updated with:

1. Exact error messages and their interpretation
2. Specific resolution steps for each error
3. Prevention strategies to avoid similar issues in future deployments
