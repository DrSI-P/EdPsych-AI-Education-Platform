# EdPsych Connect Design System

## Overview

The EdPsych Connect Design System is a comprehensive visual framework designed to create a premium, world-class educational platform with global appeal. The system prioritizes accessibility, engagement, and a consistent user experience across all devices and user groups.

## Design Principles

1. **Inclusive Accessibility**: Designed for all users, including those with dyslexia or other learning differences
2. **Educational Psychology-Informed**: Visual elements support learning and engagement based on educational psychology principles
3. **Global Appeal**: Professional aesthetics that resonate with diverse international audiences
4. **Responsive Perfection**: Seamless experience across all device sizes
5. **Purposeful Animation**: Motion design that enhances usability without distraction

## Color System

The color system features a sophisticated palette inspired by educational psychology:

### Primary Palette
- Primary colors in indigo/purple tones (6366f1) represent knowledge and wisdom
- Used for primary actions, navigation, and key UI elements

### Secondary Palette
- Secondary colors in magenta/pink tones (d946ef) create engagement and energy
- Used for highlighting important features and secondary actions

### Accent Palette
- Accent colors in teal/green tones (10b981) represent growth and progress
- Used for success states, progress indicators, and positive feedback

### Neutral Palette
- Carefully balanced grayscale for text, backgrounds, and UI elements
- Ensures proper contrast and readability

### Semantic Colors
- Success: Green (#22c55e)
- Warning: Orange (#f97316)
- Error: Red (#ef4444)
- Info: Blue (#0ea5e9)

All colors are available in various shades and support both light and dark modes with proper contrast ratios for accessibility.

## Typography

### Font Families
- **Lexend**: Primary sans-serif font optimized for readability and dyslexia-friendly
- **Literata**: Secondary serif font for headings and educational content
- **JetBrains Mono**: Monospace font for code examples and technical content

### Type Scale
The typography system uses a fluid type scale that adjusts based on viewport size:
- Base size: 16px (1rem)
- Scale: 1.25 (major third)
- Responsive adjustments for different screen sizes

### Accessibility Features
- Optimized letter spacing and line height
- Dyslexia-friendly mode with increased spacing
- High contrast options for visually impaired users

## Spacing System

Based on a 4px grid system (0.25rem), the spacing scale provides consistent spacing throughout the interface:
- 4px (0.25rem)
- 8px (0.5rem)
- 12px (0.75rem)
- 16px (1rem)
- 20px (1.25rem)
- 24px (1.5rem)
- 32px (2rem)
- And so on...

## Component System

The design system includes a comprehensive set of UI components:

### Core Components
- **Button**: Multiple variants, sizes, and states with consistent styling
- **Input**: Form controls with validation states and accessibility features
- **Card**: Flexible content containers with various styling options
- **Badge**: Compact labels for status and categorization
- **Avatar**: User profile images with fallback and status indicators
- **Alert**: Notification components for system messages

### Layout Components
- **Navigation**: Responsive navigation bar with mobile support
- **Footer**: Customizable footer with various content sections
- **Hero**: Impactful hero sections for key pages
- **Feature Section**: Flexible layouts for showcasing features and content

### Animation System
- Subtle micro-interactions enhance usability
- Reduced motion options for accessibility
- Consistent timing and easing functions

## Implementation

The design system is implemented using:
- CSS variables for design tokens
- TypeScript for type-safe component props
- Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
- Class Variance Authority (CVA) for component variants

## Usage Guidelines

### Component Selection
- Use the appropriate component for each UI need
- Maintain consistent spacing between components
- Follow accessibility best practices

### Color Usage
- Use primary colors for main actions and navigation
- Use secondary colors for highlighting and emphasis
- Use accent colors sparingly for important elements
- Maintain proper contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text)

### Typography Guidelines
- Use appropriate heading levels (h1-h6) for document structure
- Maintain consistent text sizes and weights
- Ensure proper line length (50-75 characters) for readability

### Responsive Design
- Test all interfaces across device sizes
- Use appropriate breakpoints for layout changes
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile

## Accessibility Compliance

The design system is built with accessibility in mind:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast requirements
- Reduced motion options

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the design system:
- Additional specialized components for educational content
- Expanded animation library for learning interactions
- Internationalization support for RTL languages
- Custom icon library specific to educational contexts
