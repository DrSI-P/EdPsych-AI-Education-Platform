## Educational Psychology Foundations

The Calendar Optimization for Activities feature is built on solid educational psychology principles:

1. **Cognitive Load Management**: Scheduling complex tasks during optimal cognitive periods
2. **Spaced Practice**: Distributing similar activities to enhance learning and retention
3. **Task Switching Costs**: Minimizing context switching by batching similar activities
4. **Attention Restoration**: Scheduling breaks and recovery periods to maintain effectiveness
5. **Collaborative Efficacy**: Optimizing group activities for maximum productivity
6. **Work-Life Balance**: Ensuring sustainable workloads to prevent burnout

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
- Calendar Management Service: Core scheduling and calendar manipulation
- Activity Optimization Engine: AI-powered scheduling suggestions and optimization
- Conflict Resolution System: Detection and resolution of scheduling conflicts
- Integration Layer: Connections to other platform components and external calendars
- Notification System: Reminders, alerts, and schedule change notifications

### Data Flow
1. Activities are created manually or generated from other platform components
2. Activities are categorized and prioritized by the optimization engine
3. Optimal scheduling suggestions are generated based on available time slots
4. Users can accept, modify, or reject scheduling suggestions
5. Scheduled activities are monitored for completion and outcomes
6. Schedule analytics provide insights for future optimization

### API Integration
- RESTful API endpoints for calendar operations and activity management
- WebSocket connections for real-time calendar updates and notifications
- Integration with external calendar systems (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, etc.)
- iCalendar format support for cross-platform compatibility

## User Experience

### Educator Experience
- Intuitive calendar interface with day, week, month, and agenda views
- Drag-and-drop activity scheduling with intelligent placement suggestions
- Visual indicators for activity types, priorities, and scheduling conflicts
