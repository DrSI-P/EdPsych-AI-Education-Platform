# Third-Party Plugin Architecture and Google Drive Integration

This document outlines the design and implementation of the Third-Party Plugin Architecture and Google Drive Integration for the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform.

## Plugin Architecture Overview

The plugin architecture is designed to allow seamless integration of third-party educational tools while maintaining security, stability, and admin control. The system follows these key principles:

1. **Admin-Only Management**: Only administrators can install, configure, and manage plugins
2. **Extensibility**: The architecture supports various plugin types for different educational needs
3. **Security**: Strict permission controls and sandboxing for third-party code
4. **Standardization**: Consistent interfaces for different plugin types
5. **Monitoring**: Usage tracking and error reporting for all plugins

### Core Components

1. **Plugin Registry**: Central management system for all plugins
2. **Plugin Types**: Standardised interfaces for different plugin capabilities
3. **Permission System**: Granular control over plugin access to platform data
4. **Event System**: Communication between plugins and the platform
5. **Admin Interface**: Management dashboard for plugin configuration

### Plugin Types

The architecture supports several plugin types to address different educational needs:

1. **Assessment Tool Plugins**: Integration with cognitive assessment platforms
2. **Content Provider Plugins**: Access to educational resources and materials
3. **Accessibility Tool Plugins**: Enhanced support for diverse learning needs
4. **Data Integration Plugins**: Connection with external data sources and services

## Google Drive Integration

The Google Drive integration provides bi-directional sync and collaborative editing capabilities for educational documents, presentations, and spreadsheets.

### Key Features

1. **Bi-directional Sync**: Changes in either the platform or Google Drive are reflected in both places
2. **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time collaboration on documents within the platform
3. **Selective Sync**: Control over which content is synchronized
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of conflicting changes
5. **Privacy Controls**: Granular permissions for shared content

### Implementation Details

1. **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure connection to Google Drive API
2. **File Management**: Create, read, update, and delete operations
3. **Change Tracking**: Monitoring for changes in both systems
4. **Embedded Editing**: In-platform editing of Google documents
5. **Folder Mapping**: Structured organisation between platform and Drive

## External Educational Tools Research

Research has identified several UK-based educational tools with free tiers that can enhance the platform through the plugin architecture:

### Cognitive Assessment Tools
- **CogniFit Education**: Cognitive assessment and training with API access
- **GL Assessment Digital**: UK-specific cognitive ability tests
- **SNAP-SpLD**: Special Needs Assessment Profile for learning difficulties

### Special Educational Needs Support
- **Twinkl SEN Resources**: Comprehensive SEN teaching resources with content API
- **Boardmaker Online**: Symbol-based communication platform
- **IDL Literacy & Numeracy**: Intervention programs for literacy and numeracy difficulties

### Mental Health and Wellbeing
- **Zumos**: UK-based mental wellbeing platform for schools
- **Kooth**: Digital mental health support with SSO integration
- **Anna Freud Schools in Mind**: Mental health resources for schools

### Post-16 Planning
- **UCAS**: UK university admissions service with partner API
- **National Careers Service**: Free UK government career guidance
- **Unifrog**: University and apprenticeship search platform

### Assistive Technology
- **TextHelp Read&Write**: Literacy support with browser extension integration
- **ClaroRead**: Text-to-speech and reading support
- **Scanning Pens**: Portable text-to-speech scanning devices

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Plugin registry and management system
- Plugin type definitions and interfaces
- Admin management interface

### Phase 2: Google Drive Integration
- OAuth2 authentication flow
- Bi-directional sync implementation
- Collaborative editing support

### Phase 3: Initial Plugin Templates
- Assessment tool plugin template
- Content provider plugin template
- Assistive technology plugin template

### Phase 4: First Integrations
- CogniFit Education integration
- Twinkl SEN Resources integration
- TextHelp Read&Write integration

## Educational Psychology Alignment

The plugin architecture and integrations align with key educational psychology principles:

1. **Personalized Learning**: Tools adapt to individual learning styles and needs
2. **Evidence-Based Practise**: Integration with research-backed assessment and intervention tools
3. **Accessibility**: Support for diverse learning needs through assistive technology
4. **Collaborative Learning**: Enhanced opportunities for peer and teacher collaboration
5. **Metacognition**: Tools that promote reflection on learning processes

## Next Steps

1. Implement the admin interface for plugin management
2. Complete the Google Drive OAuth2 flow implementation
3. Develop the first plugin templates for assessment tools
4. Begin integration with CogniFit Education as the first external tool
