# EdPsych AI Education Platform - Testing Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing framework implemented for the EdPsych AI Education Platform. The framework ensures all components meet quality standards, accessibility requirements, and UK educational compliance.

## Testing Components

The testing framework consists of the following components:

### 1. Accessibility Testing

Located in `src/lib/testing/components/accessibility-test.ts`, this module provides:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- ARIA attributes validation
- Color contrast checking
- Comprehensive accessibility reporting

These tools ensure the platform is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, in compliance with UK accessibility standards.

### 2. UI Component Testing

Located in `src/lib/testing/components/ui/component-test.ts`, this module provides:

- Component rendering validation
- Responsive design testing
- Variant testing for different component states
- Performance testing for UI components
- Styling and interaction validation

These tools ensure UI components are robust, performant, and provide a consistent user experience across devices.

### 3. API Testing

Located in `src/lib/testing/api/api-test.ts`, this module provides:

- API endpoint validation
- Request/response schema validation
- Authentication and security testing
- Error handling validation
- Performance monitoring

These tools ensure API endpoints are secure, performant, and handle data correctly.

### 4. End-to-End Testing

The platform uses Playwright for end-to-end testing, which:

- Validates critical user journeys
- Tests cross-browser compatibility
- Ensures feature integration works correctly
- Validates form submissions and data flow
- Tests real-world scenarios

### 5. Unit Testing

Unit tests are implemented using Jest and React Testing Library to:

- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Validate business logic
- Ensure correct handling of edge cases
- Provide fast feedback during development

## Test Execution

### Automated Testing Pipeline

The testing framework includes an automated pipeline that:

1. Runs unit and integration tests on every commit
2. Performs accessibility checks on UI components
3. Validates API endpoints against their specifications
4. Runs end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
5. Generates comprehensive test reports

### Manual Testing Checklist

In addition to automated tests, a manual testing checklist is provided for:

- Subjective quality assessment
- User experience validation
- Edge case scenarios
- Accessibility validation with assistive technologies
- Cross-device testing

## Test Reporting

The testing framework generates detailed reports that include:

- Test coverage metrics
- Pass/fail statistics
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility compliance status
- Visual regression comparisons

## UK Educational Standards Compliance

The testing framework includes specific validations for:

- UK curriculum alignment
- Age-appropriate content
- UK spelling and terminology
- Data protection and GDPR compliance
- Safeguarding requirements

## Integration with Development Workflow

The testing framework is integrated into the development workflow:

1. Pre-commit hooks run linting and unit tests
2. CI/CD pipeline runs comprehensive tests on pull requests
3. Staging deployments undergo full test suite execution
4. Production deployments require passing all tests

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing framework ensures the EdPsych AI Education Platform meets the highest standards of quality, accessibility, and compliance with UK educational requirements. By systematically validating all aspects of the platform, we ensure a robust, reliable, and inclusive experience for all users.
