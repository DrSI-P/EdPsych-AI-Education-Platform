# EdPsych AI Education Platform - Build Testing Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive build testing protocol for the EdPsych AI Education Platform. This protocol ensures that all components work together correctly in a production-like environment before deployment.

## Build Testing Process

### 1. Pre-Build Validation

Before initiating the build process:

- [ ] All feature validation checklists completed
- [ ] All automated tests passing locally
- [ ] Code linting and formatting verified
- [ ] TypeScript type checking passed
- [ ] Dependencies audited for security issues

### 2. Build Process

The build process includes:

- [ ] Clean build environment setup
- [ ] Dependencies installation from lockfile
- [ ] TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Asset optimization
- [ ] Bundle generation
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration

### 3. Build Output Validation

After the build completes:

- [ ] Build artifacts present and correctly structured
- [ ] Bundle size within acceptable limits
- [ ] No build warnings or errors
- [ ] Source maps generated correctly
- [ ] Static assets properly included

### 4. Deployment Testing

Test the build in a staging environment:

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] API endpoints functioning
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] External service integrations functioning

### 5. Performance Testing

Validate performance metrics:

- [ ] Page load times within acceptable limits
- [ ] Time to interactive within acceptable limits
- [ ] API response times within acceptable limits
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] CPU usage within acceptable limits

### 6. Cross-Browser Testing

Verify functionality across browsers:

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

### 7. Accessibility Validation

Confirm accessibility compliance:

- [ ] Automated accessibility tests pass
- [ ] Manual screen reader testing completed
- [ ] Keyboard navigation verified
- [ ] Color contrast requirements met
- [ ] ARIA attributes correctly implemented

### 8. Security Testing

Verify security measures:

- [ ] Content Security Policy correctly implemented
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms secure
- [ ] Authorization checks functioning
- [ ] Input validation working correctly
- [ ] No sensitive information exposed

### 9. Regression Testing

Ensure no regressions:

- [ ] Critical user journeys tested
- [ ] Previously fixed bugs verified
- [ ] Core functionality working as expected
- [ ] Integration points functioning correctly

### 10. Final Approval

Before release:

- [ ] All test results documented
- [ ] Issues addressed or documented with workarounds
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Deployment plan reviewed
- [ ] Rollback plan established

## Build Testing Tools

The following tools are used in the build testing process:

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end and cross-browser testing
- **Lighthouse**: For performance and accessibility auditing
- **TypeScript**: For type checking
- **ESLint**: For code quality verification
- **Webpack Bundle Analyzer**: For bundle size analysis
- **axe-core**: For accessibility testing

## Build Testing Environments

Testing occurs in these environments:

1. **Local Development**: Initial testing during development
2. **CI Environment**: Automated testing on pull requests
3. **Staging Environment**: Pre-production testing
4. **Production Simulation**: Final verification before release

## Build Testing Automation

The build testing process is automated through:

- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated test suites
- Performance monitoring tools
- Accessibility validation tools
- Security scanning tools

## Build Testing Documentation

All build testing results are documented in:

- Test run reports
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility compliance reports
- Security audit reports
- Issue tracking system

## Conclusion

This rigorous build testing protocol ensures that the EdPsych AI Education Platform meets the highest standards of quality, performance, accessibility, and security before deployment to production.
