# UK Spelling Package Fix

## Issues Fixed

We identified and fixed the following issues that were causing Vercel deployment failures:

1. **UK Spelling in Package Names**
   - The deployment was failing with error: `npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/colour/-/colour-3.2.1.tgz - Not found`
   - We enhanced the `fix-package-names.js` script to handle additional UK spelling variants:
     - Added specific handling for `@zag-js/colour-picker` → `@zag-js/color-picker`
     - Added specific handling for `@zag-js/colour-utils` → `@zag-js/color-utils`
     - Added specific handling for `colour-support` → `color-support`
     - Fixed the resolved URLs in package-lock.json that were still using UK spelling

2. **Previous Fixes (Already Implemented)**
   - Fixed apostrophes in single quotes causing syntax errors
   - Fixed template literals
   - Fixed import statements
   - Created SimpleTabs component to handle custom props
   - Fixed TypeScript errors

## Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced fix-package-names.js Script**
   - Added special case handling for @zag-js scoped packages
   - Added direct URL replacements for resolved package URLs
   - Ran the script to update package-lock.json

2. **Applied All Fixes**
   - Created and ran apply-all-fixes.js to apply all fixes in sequence
   - Verified all TypeScript errors were fixed
   - Updated dependencies with npm install

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the fixed version:

1. **Get a Vercel Token**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - Create a new token with appropriate permissions
   - Copy the token

2. **Update the Deployment Script**
   - Open either `clear-vercel-cache-and-redeploy.js` or `vercel-deploy.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_VERCEL_TOKEN` with your actual Vercel token
   - Note: `clear-vercel-cache-and-redeploy.js` uses "master" as the git ref, while `vercel-deploy.js` uses "main". Make sure to use the correct branch name for your repository.

3. **Run the Deployment Script**
   ```bash
   node clear-vercel-cache-and-redeploy.js
   # OR
   node vercel-deploy.js
   ```

4. **Monitor the Deployment**
   - The script will output a URL where you can check the deployment status
   - Go to that URL to monitor the progress of your deployment

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:

1. The build completes successfully without package name errors
2. The application loads correctly
3. All features work as expected

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize on US Spelling**
   - Ensure all new dependencies use US spelling to avoid similar issues
   - Consider adding a pre-commit hook to check for UK spelling in package names

2. **Automated Deployment Checks**
   - Add a CI step to verify package names before deployment
   - Consider implementing automated tests for deployment readiness
