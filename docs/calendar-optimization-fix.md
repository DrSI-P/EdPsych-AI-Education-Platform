# Calendar Optimization Spelling Fix

## Issue

The EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform was experiencing build failures due to inconsistent use of UK vs US spelling in component names and imports related to the Calendar Optimization feature. Specifically:

1. The component was named with UK spelling (`CalendarOptimisation`) in some files and US spelling (`CalendarOptimization`) in others
2. The file paths used both UK spelling (`calendar-optimisation`) and US spelling (`calendar-optimization`)
3. Imports were inconsistent, sometimes using UK spelling and sometimes US spelling

This inconsistency caused build failures when the code tried to import components that didn't match the expected spelling.

## Solution

We standardized all instances to use US spelling consistently:

1. Updated the component import in `src/app/educator/calendar-optimisation/page.tsx` to use US spelling:
   ```javascript
   // From
   import { CalendarOptimisation } from '@/components/educator/calendar-optimisation';
   
   // To
   import { CalendarOptimization } from '@/components/educator/calendar-optimization';
   ```

2. Updated the component usage in JSX:
   ```jsx
   // From
   <CalendarOptimisation />
   
   // To
   <CalendarOptimization />
   ```

3. Updated all text content in the page to use US spelling:
   - Changed "Optimisation" to "Optimization"
   - Changed "organise" to "organize"
   - Changed "categorise" to "categorize"
   - Changed "practise" to "practice"

4. Created scripts to automate the renaming of files and fixing of imports:
   - `fix-calendar-optimization-path.js`: Renames the directory from UK to US spelling
   - `fix-calendar-component-imports.js`: Fixes imports in all files that use the component

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Import Fix

We updated the import statement in `src/app/educator/calendar-optimisation/page.tsx` to use the US spelling version of the component:

```javascript
import { CalendarOptimization } from '@/components/educator/calendar-optimization';
```

### 2. Text Content Standardization

We standardized all text content to use US spelling:

- "Calendar Optimisation" → "Calendar Optimization"
- "organise" → "organize"
- "categorise" → "categorize"
- "practise" → "practice"

### 3. File Path Fix

We created a script (`fix-calendar-optimization-path.js`) that:
- Checks if the UK spelling directory exists (`src/app/educator/calendar-optimisation`)
- If the US spelling directory already exists, copies the content from UK to US
- Otherwise, renames the directory from UK to US spelling

### 4. Component Import Fix

We created a script (`fix-calendar-component-imports.js`) that:
- Searches for files importing the UK spelling component
- Updates the imports to use US spelling
- Updates any JSX usage of the component to use US spelling

## Verification

To verify the fixes:

1. Run the fix scripts:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-calendar-component-imports.js
   node scripts/fix-calendar-optimization-path.js
   ```

2. Check that the US spelling directory exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la src/app/educator/calendar-optimization
   ```

3. Verify that the page imports and uses the US spelling component:
   ```bash
   grep -r "CalendarOptimization" src/app/educator/
   ```

4. Build the project to ensure no build errors:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Integration with Other Fixes

These fixes have been integrated into the main `apply-all-fixes.js` script, which applies all necessary fixes for successful deployment. The script runs the calendar optimization fixes in the following order:

1. `fix-calendar-component-imports.js`
2. `fix-calendar-optimization-path.js`

This ensures that all imports are updated before the file paths are changed.
