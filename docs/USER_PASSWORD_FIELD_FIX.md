# User Password Field Fix

## Issue

During the Vercel deployment process, we encountered a TypeScript error:

```
Type error: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'password' does not exist in type '(Without<UserUpdateInput, UserUncheckedUpdateInput> & UserUncheckedUpdateInput) | (Without<...> & UserUpdateInput)'.
```

This error occurred in `src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts` on line 123, where the code was trying to update a user's password with:

```typescript
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: resetRecord.userId },
  data: { password: hashedPassword },
});
```

## Root Cause

The User model in the Prisma schema didn't have a `password` field, but the reset-password route was trying to update this non-existent field. This is a common issue when using an ORM like Prisma, where the schema must accurately reflect all fields used in the application code.

## Solution

1. We added the `password` field to the User model in the Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  password              String?
  // ... other fields
}
```

2. We created a migration file to add this field to the existing User table in the database:

```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN "password" TEXT;
```

3. We committed these changes to the repository.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema-Code Consistency**: Always ensure that the Prisma schema accurately reflects all fields used in the application code.

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's type checking can help identify mismatches between the schema and the code, but only if the types are properly defined and used.

3. **Authentication Implementation**: When implementing authentication features like password reset, ensure that the necessary database fields exist to support these features.

4. **Documentation**: Document any changes to the schema, especially those related to authentication and security features, to help future developers understand the system's design.

## Related Issues

This issue is similar to the PasswordReset model issue documented in [PASSWORD_RESET_MODEL_FIX.md](./PASSWORD_RESET_MODEL_FIX.md) and the AssessmentTemplate model issue documented in [MIGRATION_FIX.md](./MIGRATION_FIX.md), where models or fields were referenced in the code but not defined in the schema.
