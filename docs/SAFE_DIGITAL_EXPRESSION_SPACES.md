## Evidence Base

The Safe Digital Expression Spaces feature is grounded in established educational psychology principles and research:

1. **Expressive Writing Research**: Based on studies showing that writing about emotions and experiences can reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing.

2. **Art Therapy Principles**: Incorporates evidence that creative expression can help process complex emotions and experiences in ways that verbal expression alone cannot.

3. **Peer Support Benefits**: Research indicates that moderated peer support can reduce feelings of isolation and normalize experiences.

4. **Digital Safeguarding Framework**: Implements UK safeguarding guidelines for digital spaces used by children and young people.

5. **Multimodal Expression**: Recognizes that different students express themselves most effectively through different mediums.
