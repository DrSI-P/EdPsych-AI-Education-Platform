## Introduction Clips

### Welcome Introduction
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Background:** Calm, sensory-friendly environment
**Script:**
```
Hello there. My name is Sam, and I'm here to support you on your learning journey. 

This is a safe space where we can work together at your own pace. Everyone learns differently, and that's something to celebrate.

I'm here to help you discover strategies that work best for you, and to provide support whenever you need it. We'll take things one step at a time, and it's always okay to ask questions or take breaks when you need them.

I'm looking forward to working with you.

### Platform Introduction for Special Needs
**Duration:** 45 seconds
**Background:** Organized, low-distraction environment
**Script:**
```
Welcome to EdPsych Connect. I'm Jordan, and I'll be showing you how this platform can be adjusted to work best for you.

EdPsych Connect has many features that can be personalized to match how you learn best. We can adjust the colors, text size, and even how information is presented to make learning more comfortable and effective for you.

There are also tools to help with organization, focus, and emotional regulation. We'll explore these together, and you can decide which ones are most helpful for you.

Remember, there's no rush. We can go at whatever pace feels right, and you can always come back to review anything we cover.

### Executive Function Support
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Background:** Organized workspace with visual schedules
**Script:**
```
Today we're going to talk about tools that can help with planning and organization. I know these things can sometimes feel challenging, but EdPsych Connect has features specifically designed to help.

First, let's look at the visual schedule tool. This shows your daily tasks with clear images and time blocks. You can see exactly what's coming next, which can help reduce anxiety about transitions.

The task breakdown feature is also really helpful. It takes big assignments and breaks them into smaller, manageable steps. For example, instead of "write an essay," you'll see steps like "choose a topic," "create an outline," and so on.

The reminder system can send you gentle alerts when it's time to move to a new activity or when an assignment is due soon.

Let's practice using these tools together, and remember - it's okay to adjust them until they work just right for you.

### Sensory Regulation Strategies
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Background:** Calm environment with sensory tools visible
**Script:**
```
When we're learning, sometimes our senses can feel overwhelmed, making it difficult to focus. Today I'd like to share some strategies that might help when things feel too bright, loud, or busy.

EdPsych Connect has display settings that let you adjust the colors and contrast. If bright screens bother your eyes, try the "reduced brightness" mode or the "warm color" filter.

For times when you need to focus, the platform has a "focus mode" that removes distracting elements from the screen. You can also use noise-cancelling headphones or listen to the calming background sounds in the wellbeing section.

If you need to move while learning, that's completely okay. The platform works on mobile devices so you can stand, stretch, or even walk gently while engaging with content.

Remember, you can access the "Take a Break" button anytime to use guided breathing exercises or quick movement breaks.

These strategies can help create a learning environment that feels right for your sensory needs.

### Managing Frustration
**Duration:** 45 seconds
**Background:** Calming blue tones, minimal distractions
**Script:**
```
I notice that you might be feeling frustrated right now, and that's completely understandable. Learning new things can be challenging sometimes.

When we feel frustrated, our bodies and minds need a moment to reset. Let's try a quick strategy together.

First, let's take three deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four... and out through your mouth for a count of six. Let's do that two more times.

Now, it might help to name what you're feeling. You might say to yourself, "I'm feeling frustrated because this is difficult."

Remember, feeling stuck is part of learning. It doesn't mean you can't do it - it just means you haven't figured it out yet.

Would you like to take a short break, or try a different approach to this task? Both options are completely okay.
```

### Celebrating Small Wins
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Background:** Warm, positive environment
**Script:**
```
I want to take a moment to recognize the progress you've made today. You completed that task even though it was challenging, and that shows real determination.

Every small step forward is worth celebrating. Learning isn't just about getting everything right the first time - it's about trying, learning from mistakes, and continuing to grow.

I've noticed how you're developing strategies that work for you, and that's a really important skill. You should feel proud of your efforts today.

What's something you feel good about from today's work? It's important to recognize your own achievements, no matter how small they might seem.

## Transition Clips

### Preparing for a Transition
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Background:** Clear, structured environment
**Script:**
```
In five minutes, we'll be moving from our current activity to a new one. I wanted to let you know in advance so you can prepare for this change.

Our next activity will be [brief description of upcoming activity]. You'll need [any materials required] for this.

Before we transition, let's finish up what we're working on. If you need a little more time, that's okay - just let me know.

When we're ready to switch, we'll take a few deep breaths together to help our minds transition smoothly from one activity to the next.

I'll give you another reminder when we have one minute left.
```

### Ending a Session
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Background:** Calm, organized environment
**Script:**
```
We're coming to the end of our session today. Let's take a moment to think about what we've accomplished.

First, we worked on [recap first activity]. Then we practiced [recap second activity]. You showed real strength in [specific positive observation].

Before we finish, let's organize your materials so they're ready for next time. [Brief instructions for clean-up if needed]

Now, let's take three deep breaths together to signal the end of our work today.

Remember, you can review anything we covered today in the "Recent Activities" section if you want to refresh your memory later. Great job today, and I look forward to our next session.

### Emotional Regulation Guide
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Background:** Calm environment with emotion chart visible
**Script:**
```
Understanding and managing our emotions is an important skill that helps us in learning and in life. Today, I'd like to introduce you to the emotion toolkit in EdPsych Connect.

First, we have the emotion meter that helps you identify how you're feeling. You can move the slider to show if you're feeling calm, happy, worried, frustrated, or any emotion in between.

Once you've identified your feeling, the platform offers strategies that might help. For example, if you're feeling anxious, you might try the guided breathing exercise or the progressive muscle relaxation.

The emotion journal lets you track your feelings over time and notice any patterns. This can be really helpful for understanding what situations might trigger certain emotions.

Remember, all emotions are valid and provide important information. The goal isn't to never feel difficult emotions, but to have strategies to manage them when they arise.

Would you like to explore the emotion toolkit together now?

### Social Skills Support
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Background:** Setting with visual social cues
**Script:**
```
Social interactions are a part of learning, and sometimes they can feel complicated. EdPsych Connect has resources that can help make social situations clearer and more comfortable.

The social stories section provides examples of different social scenarios you might encounter, with clear explanations of what to expect and how you might respond.

For group work, there are visual guides that show how to join a conversation, take turns speaking, or respectfully disagree with someone's idea.

The platform also has a private practice area where you can rehearse social interactions before trying them in real life. This includes video examples and interactive scenarios.

Remember, it's okay to communicate your needs to others. The "Communication Cards" feature lets you create quick messages you can share when you need a break or have something important to express.

Social skills develop with practice, just like any other skill. Be patient with yourself as you learn and grow in this area.
