### Using the Assessment Module
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Background:** Digital classroom

Today, I'll guide you through using the EdPsych Connect assessment module. This powerful tool revolutionizes how we evaluate learning and gather pupil voice.

The assessment module supports multiple question types including multiple choice, open-ended, matching, and file upload responses. What makes our assessment truly special is the AI-powered analysis, which can automatically grade responses while providing nuanced feedback that goes beyond simple right or wrong answers.

To create a new assessment, click the "Create" button in the top right corner. You'll be able to select from various question types, set grading parameters, and align with curriculum standards. Let's walk through this process step by step...

Effective curriculum planning is essential for creating structured learning journeys. The EdPsych Connect curriculum planning module makes this process intuitive and powerful.

To begin, navigate to the Curriculum section and select "Create New Plan." You'll be able to align your plan with UK curriculum standards using our learning objective management system, which breaks down complex skills into manageable components.

The platform provides curriculum templates based on best practices, which you can customise to meet the needs of different learners and contexts. Our collaboration tools enable teams of educators to work together, sharing expertise and resources.

Let me demonstrate how to create a differentiated curriculum plan that accommodates diverse learning needs...

### Providing Reassurance
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Background:** Calm, supportive setting

It's completely normal to find certain concepts challenging or to feel uncertain about your progress at times. Learning is not always a straight path forwardâ€”it involves exploration, mistakes, and moments of difficulty.

What's important is that you're engaging with the material and making an effort. Every question you ask and every attempt you make contributes to your understanding, even if it doesn't feel that way immediately.

Remember that I'm here to support you, and we'll work through these challenges together. With patience and persistence, you'll develop both knowledge and confidence.
