# Parent Education Resources for Restorative Justice

## Overview

This document synthesizes key insights from the platform's educational psychology resources to inform the development of parent education resources for restorative justice. The goal is to create practical, evidence-based materials that help parents understand and implement restorative approaches at home, ensuring consistency between school and home environments.

## Key Principles for Parent Resources

### 1. Home-School Consistency

Parents need resources that align with school-based restorative practices to ensure:
- Consistent language and terminology across environments
- Compatible approaches to conflict resolution
- Shared understanding of restorative principles
- Reinforcement of school-based learning at home

### 2. Developmental Appropriateness

Parent resources must be tailored to children's developmental stages:
- Age-appropriate language and expectations
- Stage-specific strategies and approaches
- Recognition of developmental capabilities and limitations
- Guidance for adapting approaches as children mature

### 3. Practical Implementation

Resources should emphasize practical application:
- Clear, step-by-step guidance for restorative conversations
- Concrete examples and scenarios relevant to home settings
- Simple tools that can be implemented without specialised training
- Realistic expectations for busy family environments

### 4. Evidence-Based Approach

All resources should be grounded in educational psychology research:
- Connection to affect script psychology and emotional regulation
- Integration with attachment theory and relationship-building
- Alignment with restorative justice principles and practices
- References to supporting research and outcomes
