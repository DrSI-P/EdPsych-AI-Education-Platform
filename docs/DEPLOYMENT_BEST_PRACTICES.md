# Deployment Best Practices for EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform

This document outlines best practices for deploying the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform to Vercel and other environments, with a focus on reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Vercel Deployment

### Configuration Optimization

1. **Minimal Configuration**
   - Keep `vercel.json` as simple as possible
   - Only add complexity when specific features require it
   - Use the following minimal configuration as a starting point:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "framework": "nextjs",
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "installCommand": "npm install"
   }
   ```

2. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Avoid experimental features in production deployments
   - Minimize custom webpack configurations
   - Use the following simplified configuration as a base:
   ```javascript
   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
     swcMinify: true,
     images: {
       domains: ['images.unsplash.com', 'via.placeholder.com'],
     },
     i18n: {
       locales: ['en-GB', 'fr', 'es', 'de', 'pl', 'ur'],
       defaultLocale: 'en-GB',
     }
   };
   
   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Store all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Prefix client-side variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
   - Document all required environment variables

### Build Optimization

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly audit and update dependencies
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Use specific versions rather than ranges
   - Consider using `npm ci` instead of `npm install`

2. **Build Performance**
   - Enable SWC minification for faster builds
   - Implement code splitting for better performance
   - Optimise image assets using Next.js Image component
   - Consider using Next.js static export for purely static pages

3. **Incremental Deployment**
   - Use incremental static regeneration where appropriate
   - Implement fallback pages for dynamic routes
   - Consider using Vercel's preview deployments for testing

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Integration

1. **Workflow Configuration**
   - Implement comprehensive testing before deployment
   - Use environment-specific configurations
   - Implement proper secret management
   - Example workflow structure:
     - Test (lint, unit tests, accessibility tests)
     - Build
     - Deploy to staging
     - E2E tests
     - Deploy to production

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Run unit tests on every push
   - Run integration tests before deployment
   - Run E2E tests on staging environment
   - Implement accessibility testing

3. **Deployment Approval**
   - Consider implementing manual approval for production deployments
   - Use environment protection rules in GitHub
   - Implement rollback procedures

## DNS and Domain Management

1. **Domain Configuration**
   - Use Vercel for DNS management when possible
   - Implement proper SSL configuration
   - Set up proper redirects for www and non-www domains

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Configure proper caching headers
   - Implement CDN integration
   - Consider using Vercel Edge Functions for regional optimization

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Deployment Monitoring**
   - Use Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
   - Implement error tracking with Sentry or similar tools
   - Set up alerts for deployment failures

2. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Schedule regular dependency updates
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities
   - Implement automated testing for regression prevention

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Check for syntax errors in configuration files

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify API routes are functioning correctly
   - Check for client-side vs. server-side code issues

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Analyse bundle size
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Optimise database queries and API calls

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

1. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Maintain up-to-date deployment documentation
   - Document environment-specific configurations
   - Create troubleshooting guides

2. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Train team members on deployment procedures
   - Document lessons learned from deployment issues
   - Create video tutorials for common deployment tasks

By following these best practices, the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform can maintain a reliable, performant, and maintainable deployment process that supports the educational mission of the platform.
