# Student Voice Amplification and Transcription System

## Overview

The Student Voice Amplification and Transcription System is a comprehensive set of tools designed to collect, amplify, and respond to student perspectives while providing essential support for English as an Additional Language (EAL) students. This system empowers all students to express their thoughts, ideas, and feedback through multiple modalities, ensuring that every student's voice is heard regardless of language barriers or communication preferences.

## Key Components

- **Multi-language Translation**: Translates educational content between 15+ languages, supporting diverse linguistic backgrounds.
- **Voice Recording and Processing**: Allows students and teachers to record speech for transcription and translation.
- **Key Vocabulary Management**: Creates and manages translated vocabulary lists with definitions across multiple languages.
- **Classroom Support Tools**: Provides live transcription of lessons with translation capabilities and export options.
- **Context-aware Processing**: Maintains educational context during translation to ensure accurate meaning preservation.
