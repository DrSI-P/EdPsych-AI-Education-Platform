### 2. Meeting Note Transcription Training (3-5 minutes)

#### Introduction (30 seconds)
```
Welcome to this training session on the Meeting Note Transcription feature of the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform. I'll be guiding you through this powerful tool designed to automatically transcribe and analyse educational meetings, with a special focus on EHCNA-aligned key point extraction.

This feature significantly reduces administrative burden while ensuring comprehensive documentation of student needs and strengths in alignment with Education, Health and Care Needs Assessment requirements.
```

#### Feature Overview (45 seconds)
```
The Meeting Note Transcription feature uses advanced AI to convert spoken meeting content into structured, searchable text with automatic categorisation into the four EHCNA domains:

Communication and Interaction
Cognition and Learning
Social, Emotional and Mental Health
Sensory and Physical

For students in Year 9 and above, the system also categorises information related to preparation for adulthood, focusing on employment, independent living, community inclusion, and health.
```

#### Recording a Meeting (60 seconds)
```
To use this feature, start by selecting "New Meeting" and choosing the appropriate meeting type, such as EHCNA Meeting or Annual Review.

You can then record the meeting directly through the platform or upload an existing audio file. The system will automatically transcribe the content and begin processing.

For optimal results, ensure good audio quality and introduce speakers at the beginning of the meeting. The system will attempt to distinguish between different voices, but clear introductions improve accuracy.

You can pause recording at any time, and the system will continue transcription when resumed.
```

#### EHCNA Categorisation (60 seconds)
```
Once transcription is complete, the system automatically categorises content according to the four EHCNA domains.

Each section is colour-coded for easy identification, with strengths, needs, and impact clearly distinguished within each domain.

For students in Year 9 and above, you'll notice additional categorisation related to preparation for adulthood, helping ensure this crucial aspect of EHCNA is properly documented.

The system also identifies and tags action items, assigning them to relevant team members and categorising them by EHCNA domain.
```

#### Editing and Refining (45 seconds)
```
While the AI is highly accurate, you can easily edit the transcription and categorisation if needed.

Simply click on any section to make adjustments, add additional information, or recategorise content.

You can also highlight particularly important points, add comments, or link to relevant documents and assessments.

The system maintains a complete edit history, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the process.
```

#### Sharing and Integration (45 seconds)
```
Once you're satisfied with the transcription and categorisation, you can share the document with relevant team members, maintaining appropriate privacy controls.

The system integrates with other platform features, automatically suggesting relevant resources based on identified needs and linking to student profiles for comprehensive record-keeping.

You can export the document in various formats, including PDF and Word, for inclusion in official EHCNA documentation.
```

#### Conclusion (30 seconds)
```
The Meeting Note Transcription feature transforms what was once a time-consuming administrative task into an efficient, structured process that enhances the quality of EHCNA documentation.

By automatically categorising information according to EHCNA requirements and preparation for adulthood, it ensures comprehensive assessment while significantly reducing administrative burden.

We encourage you to explore this feature further and discover how it can enhance your EHCNA processes and documentation.
```

### 3. Contextual Resource Recommendation Training (3-5 minutes)

#### Introduction (30 seconds)
```
Welcome to this training session on the Contextual Resource Recommendation Engine of the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform. I'll be guiding you through this intelligent feature designed to suggest relevant educational resources based on your specific teaching context.

This powerful tool analyses content from lesson plans, meeting notes, and student profiles to deliver personalised, relevant resource recommendations that save time and enhance teaching quality.
```

#### Feature Overview (45 seconds)
```
The Contextual Resource Recommendation Engine uses advanced AI to understand the educational context you're working in and suggest appropriate resources from our extensive library.

It extracts key topics, learning objectives, and student needs from your current work, then matches these contextual elements with appropriate resources.

The system considers multiple factors including subject relevance, age appropriateness, curriculum alignment, and special educational needs to ensure recommendations are precisely tailored to your requirements.
```

#### Contextual Recommendations in Action (60 seconds)
```
The recommendation engine works seamlessly across the platform. For example, when creating a lesson plan, you'll notice a recommendation panel appearing with suggested resources related to your topic and learning objectives.

Similarly, when reviewing meeting notes with EHCNA categorisation, the system will suggest resources specifically designed to support the identified needs in each domain.

When viewing a student profile, you'll receive recommendations tailored to that student's specific learning needs, preferences, and goals.

In each case, the system explains why resources are being suggested, helping you make informed decisions about which materials to use.
```

#### Filtering and Refining (45 seconds)
```
While the AI is excellent at suggesting relevant resources, you maintain complete control over the recommendations.

You can filter suggestions by resource type, subject, age range, or specific learning needs to narrow down the options.

The system learns from your selections, gradually improving its recommendations based on your preferences and the resources you find most useful.

You can also provide direct feedback on recommendations, helping the system better understand your needs.
```

#### Discovering New Resources (45 seconds)
```
Beyond contextual recommendations, you can also use the engine for manual resource discovery.

The search functionality allows you to find resources using specific keywords, topics, or curriculum references.

Advanced filters help you narrow down results based on resource type, subject, age range, and special educational needs.

The system also highlights newly added resources that match your typical usage patterns, ensuring you don't miss valuable new materials.
```

#### Integration with Resource Library (30 seconds)
```
The Contextual Resource Recommendation Engine integrates seamlessly with our Resource Library, giving you access to thousands of high-quality educational materials.

You can save favourite resources for quick access, create collections for specific topics or student groups, and share resources with colleagues.

The system also tracks resource usage and effectiveness, helping you identify the most impactful materials for future use.
```

#### Conclusion (30 seconds)
```
The Contextual Resource Recommendation Engine transforms how educators discover and utilise educational resources, saving valuable time and ensuring materials are precisely matched to educational needs.

By intelligently connecting your work context with relevant resources, it helps you provide more effective, differentiated instruction without the time-consuming search for appropriate materials.

We encourage you to explore this feature further and discover how it can enhance your teaching practice through contextually relevant resource recommendations.
