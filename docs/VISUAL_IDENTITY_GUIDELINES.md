- Reduced motion alternatives for accessibility

#### Transitions
- Smooth, logical transitions between states and pages
- Consistent direction and movement patterns
- Performance-optimised animations that work across devices

#### Progress Indicators
- Clear visual feedback for loading states
- Consistent progress visualisation across learning activities
- Celebratory animations for achievements and milestones

## Implementation Guidelines

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints
- Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44px) for mobile users

### Accessibility Considerations
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all visual elements
- Colour contrast ratios that exceed minimum requirements
- Visual alternatives for all audio content
- Reduced motion options for vestibular disorders

### Design System Components
- Maintain a comprehensive component library
- Document all visual patterns and their usage guidelines
- Ensure consistent implementation across all modules

## Governance and Evolution

This visual identity should be consistently applied across all platform modules while allowing for appropriate evolution based on user feedback and educational best practices. All significant changes to the visual identity should be documented and communicated to the development team.

The visual identity will be reviewed quarterly to ensure it continues to represent the premier standard for educational technology platforms.
