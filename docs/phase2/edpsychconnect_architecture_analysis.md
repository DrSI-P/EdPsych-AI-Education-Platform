# EdPsych Connect: Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the EdPsych Connect platform's current architecture, focusing on recent additions and changes. The platform has evolved significantly with new modules for internationalization (i18n), assessment, curriculum, and gamification. This analysis examines how these components fit into the overall system and evaluates their impact on the planned Phase 2 features.

## Current Architecture Overview

The EdPsych Connect platform follows a modern Next.js architecture with TypeScript, using a combination of App Router and Pages Router patterns. The codebase is organized into several key directories:

- `/src/app` - App Router components and API routes
- `/src/pages` - Pages Router components
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/lib` - Utility functions and services
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/prisma` - Database schema and migrations

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Internationalization (i18n) System

The platform now includes a comprehensive i18n system with the following components:

- `i18n-provider.tsx` - Context provider for translations
- `language-settings.tsx` - User language preferences management
- `language-switcher.tsx` - UI component for changing languages
- `multilingual-accessibility-validator.tsx` - Ensures accessibility across languages
- `multilingual-curriculum-validator.tsx` - Validates curriculum content across languages
- `multilingual-layout.tsx` - Layout wrapper for multilingual content
- `translation-tool.tsx` - Tool for managing translations

This system supports multiple languages, including RTL languages, translation namespaces, and curriculum alignment validation across languages.

#### 2. Assessment Framework

The assessment system has been expanded with:

- Question types for various assessment formats
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Curriculum-aligned assessment tools
- Accessibility considerations for assessments

#### 3. Curriculum Management

The curriculum system includes:

- UK curriculum standards alignment
- Differentiation tools for various learning needs
- Progress tracking across curriculum areas
- Content mapping to educational standards

#### 4. Gamification Elements

New gamification features include:

- Adventure quest components
- Progress tracking and rewards
- Interactive learning elements
- Achievement systems

#### 5. Special Needs Support

Extensive special needs support features:

- Executive dysfunction tools
- Emotional regulation components
- Mindfulness activities
- IEP/504 plan integration
- Progress monitoring for interventions

#### 6. Voice Input and Accessibility

Enhanced accessibility features:

- Voice recognition components
- Multilingual accessibility validation
- Adaptive complexity for content

## Database Architecture

The Prisma schema has undergone significant expansion but faces several issues:

1. **Missing Models**: 66+ referenced models are missing from the schema
2. **Relation Issues**: Many relations reference non-existent models
3. **Schema Fragmentation**: Updates exist in separate migration files that need consolidation

Key model categories include:

- User and authentication models
- Curriculum and assessment models
- Special needs and intervention models
- Communication and collaboration models
- Professional development models

## Integration Points and Dependencies

### External Services

The platform integrates with several external services:

1. **Sentry** - For error monitoring and performance tracking
2. **HeyGen** - For AI avatar video generation
3. **Authentication Providers** - For user authentication

### Internal Dependencies

Several internal dependencies exist between components:

1. The i18n system is used across all user-facing components
2. Assessment components depend on curriculum models
3. Special needs tools integrate with progress monitoring systems
4. Voice input features are used across multiple interaction points

## Impact on Phase 2 Features

### 1. Automated Weekly Blog Content

The planned automated blog content feature will need to:

- Integrate with the i18n system for multilingual content
- Align with curriculum standards using the curriculum validation system
- Support accessibility requirements through the accessibility validators
- Consider special needs perspectives in content generation

**Current Blockers**:
- TypeScript errors in related components
- Missing Prisma models for blog content storage
- Integration issues with existing components

### 2. AI-Powered FAQ Chatbot

The AI chatbot implementation will need to:

- Support multiple languages through the i18n system
- Access curriculum data for educational queries
- Integrate with special needs support tools
- Maintain accessibility standards

**Current Blockers**:
- Component integration issues
- Missing schema definitions for chat interactions
- Potential conflicts with existing AI components

### 3. Legal Pages

The legal pages development will need to:

- Support multilingual content through the i18n system
- Meet accessibility standards
- Integrate with the overall navigation and site structure

**Current Blockers**:
- TypeScript errors affecting page rendering
- Integration with the navigation system

## Architectural Strengths

1. **Modular Design**: Components are well-organized into logical directories
2. **Comprehensive i18n**: Strong internationalization support
3. **Accessibility Focus**: Accessibility considerations throughout the codebase
4. **UK Curriculum Alignment**: Clear focus on UK educational standards
5. **Special Needs Support**: Extensive tools for diverse learning needs

## Architectural Challenges

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Numerous type safety issues throughout the codebase
2. **Schema Inconsistencies**: Missing models and relation issues
3. **Component API Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent prop naming and typing
4. **Integration Complexity**: Complex integration points between systems
5. **Build Process Issues**: Build failures during type checking

## Recommendations for Architecture Improvements

1. **Standardize Component APIs**: Establish consistent patterns for component props and types
2. **Consolidate Schema**: Merge all schema updates into the main schema
3. **Enhance Type Safety**: Implement stricter TypeScript configurations
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error boundaries
5. **Implement Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for critical components

## Conclusion

The EdPsych Connect platform has evolved into a comprehensive educational system with strong support for internationalization, assessment, curriculum management, and special needs. However, the current TypeScript errors and schema issues present significant challenges that must be addressed before proceeding with Phase 2 implementation.

The architecture provides a solid foundation for the planned Phase 2 features, but requires stabilization and error resolution to ensure successful implementation. The next steps should focus on resolving the identified errors while maintaining the platform's strengths in accessibility, curriculum alignment, and special needs support.
