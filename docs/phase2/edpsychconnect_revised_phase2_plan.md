## Timeline Impact

The revised plan extends the implementation timeline from 8 weeks to 11 weeks to accommodate the additional enhancements:

- **Original Plan**: 8 weeks (2 weeks stabilization + 6 weeks feature implementation)
- **Revised Plan**: 11 weeks (2 weeks stabilization + 2 weeks infrastructure + 7 weeks feature implementation)

This extension provides adequate time to implement the additional improvements while ensuring quality and stability. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery and validation, reducing risk and ensuring quality.

## Conclusion

This revised Phase 2 implementation plan addresses the current codebase issues while delivering enhanced features that leverage the platform's existing strengths. The additional improvements in performance, PWA capabilities, voice input, and content validation will significantly enhance the user experience and ensure the platform meets the highest standards for UK educational technology.

By prioritizing codebase stabilization and infrastructure improvements before feature implementation, we ensure a solid foundation for the platform's continued growth. Upon completion of Phase 2, the EdPsych Connect platform will offer a robust, accessible, and performant educational experience aligned with UK curriculum standards and suitable for diverse learning needs.
