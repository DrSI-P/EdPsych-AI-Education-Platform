# EdPsych Connect: Updated Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document presents an updated implementation plan for Phase 2 of the EdPsych Connect platform. Based on our comprehensive analysis of the current codebase, including error assessment and architectural review, we've revised the original Phase 2 plan to address existing issues while implementing the planned new features. This approach ensures a stable foundation for future development while delivering the key functionality requested by stakeholders.

## Implementation Priorities

### Priority 1: Codebase Stabilization

Before implementing new features, critical errors must be resolved to ensure a stable foundation:

   - Fix relation references
   - Merge schema updates from migration files

3. **Standardize Component APIs**
   - Ensure consistent prop naming across components
   - Update component usage to match current APIs
   - Improve type definitions for better type safety

### Priority 2: Phase 2 Feature Implementation

Once the codebase is stabilized, we'll implement the planned Phase 2 features:

1. **Automated Weekly Blog Content**
   - Implement AI-powered content generation system
   - Integrate with i18n for multilingual support
   - Ensure UK curriculum alignment
   - Add admin interface for review and publishing

2. **AI-Powered FAQ Chatbot**
