# CSS and Asset Loading Fix

Based on my investigation, I've identified several issues that need to be addressed to fix the styling and asset loading problems on the live site:

1. Missing logo-full.svg file that's being referenced on the live site
2. Potential issues with CSS file paths in the production build
3. Possible misconfiguration in asset prefixing for the production environment

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Create Missing Logo File
We need to create the missing logo-full.svg file that's being referenced at https://www.edpsychconnect.com/images/logo-full.svg

### 2. Fix CSS Loading
- Ensure CSS files are properly included in the build
- Check for path resolution issues in production
- Verify that Next.js is correctly handling static assets

### 3. Update Asset References
- Make sure all asset references use correct paths
- Consider adding a basePath or assetPrefix if needed for production

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the missing logo file
2. Update next.config.js if needed
3. Test the build locally
4. Deploy and verify fixes
