                    Research consistently demonstrates that whole-school approaches to mental health and wellbeing are more effective than isolated interventions. A systematic review by Weare and Nind (2011) found that multi-component, whole-school approaches that include changes to the school environment, curriculum teaching, and partnerships with families and communities have the strongest evidence of effectiveness.

                            This certification complements the DfE's designated mental health lead training but offers a more comprehensive and in-depth exploration of wellbeing leadership in schools. Whilst the DfE training provides a foundation for the role, this certification expands on those foundations with more detailed content on whole-school approaches, identification and support systems, multi-agency collaboration, and implementation strategies. Many educators complete this certification alongside the DfE training to develop a more comprehensive skill set for their wellbeing leadership role.
