                    Research consistently demonstrates the positive impact of restorative approaches in educational settings. Studies have shown reductions in exclusions and behaviour incidents, improvements in school climate and relationships, and positive effects on student wellbeing and engagement. A meta-analysis by Wong et al. (2011) found that restorative justice programs in schools were associated with significant reductions in problem behaviour and improvements in school climate.

                            This certification complements other restorative justice qualifications but is specifically designed for educational contexts. Whilst there are various restorative justice training programs available, this certification focuses on the unique challenges and opportunities of implementing restorative approaches in schools. Many educators complete this certification alongside other restorative justice qualifications to develop a comprehensive skill set that bridges criminal justice and educational applications of restorative practise.
