        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Executive Dysfunction</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Executive dysfunction refers to difficulties with the cognitive processes that help us plan, focus attention, 
          remember instructions, and manage multiple tasks. These skills are controlled by the brain's frontal lobe and 
          are critical for self-regulation and accomplishing goals.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Executive dysfunction is common in individuals with ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety, and other 
          neurodevelopmental or psychological conditions. However, it can also occur due to stress, lack of sleep, 
          or during particularly challenging life transitions.
