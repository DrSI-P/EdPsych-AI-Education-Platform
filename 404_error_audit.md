# EdPsych Connect - 404 Error Audit

## Overview
This document provides a systematic audit of 404 errors and other routing issues on the EdPsych Connect platform. These issues must be urgently fixed to ensure the website displays exactly as designed in the codebase.

## Identified Issues

### Main Navigation Links
1. ✅ **Home** (`/`) - Working correctly
2. ✅ **Student Portal** (`/student`) - Working correctly
3. ✅ **Educator Resources** (`/educator`) - Working correctly
4. ❌ **Analytics** (`/analytics`) - Client-side exception error
5. ❌ **Settings** (`/settings`) - 404 error

### Resource Pages
1. ✅ **Restorative Justice** (`/resources/restorative-justice`) - Working correctly
2. ✅ **Adaptive Learning** (`/resources/adaptive-learning`) - Working correctly
3. ✅ **Special Needs Support** (`/resources/special-needs`) - Working correctly
4. ❌ **Learning Styles** (`/resources/learning-styles`) - 404 error

## Root Causes Analysis

1. **Missing Page Components**: Several pages referenced in the navigation don't have corresponding page components in the codebase:
   - No `analytics.js` in the pages directory
   - No `settings.js` in the pages directory
   - No `learning-styles.js` in the resources directory

2. **Routing Configuration**: The Next.js routing configuration may not be properly set up for all pages, particularly for nested routes.

3. **Client-Side Exceptions**: The Analytics page is throwing client-side exceptions, likely due to missing dependencies or improper component initialization.

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)
1. Create missing page components:
   ```
   /pages/analytics.js
   /pages/settings.js
   /pages/resources/learning-styles.js
   ```

2. Ensure proper imports and component structure in all new pages:
   - Import MainNavigation and Footer components
   - Include Head component with proper metadata
   - Apply consistent branding and styling

3. Fix client-side exceptions:
   - Add error boundaries to handle potential runtime errors
   - Ensure all required dependencies are properly imported

### Implementation Steps
1. Create each missing page with proper structure
2. Test locally to ensure no 404 errors
3. Commit and push changes
4. Trigger redeployment
5. Verify all links work correctly on the live site

## Verification Checklist
After implementing fixes, verify:
- [ ] All main navigation links work without errors
- [ ] All resource page links work without errors
- [ ] No client-side exceptions are thrown
- [ ] All pages display with consistent branding and styling
- [ ] The site matches exactly what's in the codebase
