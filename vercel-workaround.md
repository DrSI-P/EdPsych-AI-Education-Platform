# Vercel Deployment Conflict Workaround

## Root Cause Identified
We've identified the exact cause of the persistent build failures and runtime errors on the EdPsych Connect platform. The Vercel build logs show a critical conflict:

```
Conflicting app and page file was found, please remove the conflicting files to continue:
"pages/analytics.js" - "app/analytics/page.tsx"
```

This indicates that despite our repository not containing an `/app` directory, Vercel's build environment is still referencing an old or cached `/app/analytics/page.tsx` file from a previous version of the project.

## Immediate Workaround Options

### Option 1: Rename the Analytics Page
1. Rename `pages/analytics.js` to `pages/analytics-dashboard.js` or another unique name
2. Update all internal links to point to the new URL
3. This avoids the conflict with the phantom `/app/analytics/page.tsx`

### Option 2: Create a New Vercel Project
1. Create a completely new Vercel project
2. Deploy the same codebase to this new project
3. Update DNS settings to point to the new deployment

### Option 3: Contact Vercel Support
Request Vercel support to:
1. Completely purge all build artifacts and caches
2. Check for and remove any hidden `/app` directory in the build environment
3. Reset the project's build environment entirely

## Long-term Solution
After implementing one of the workarounds above, we should:
1. Ensure all pages use a consistent routing approach (either Pages Router or App Router)
2. Document the routing architecture clearly for future developers
3. Implement a CI/CD process that includes cache validation

## Implementation Steps
1. Choose one of the workaround options above
2. Implement the chosen workaround
3. Verify that the build completes successfully
4. Test all pages to ensure they load without errors
5. Proceed with implementing the remaining features from the implementation checklist
