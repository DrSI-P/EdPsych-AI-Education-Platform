# EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform Development Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for developing and maintaining the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform codebase. Following these guidelines will help prevent common issues, maintain code quality, and ensure a smooth development and deployment process.

## Component Development

### Export Patterns

- **Be consistent with exports**: Choose either named exports or default exports for components and stick to the pattern.
- **Export all required sub-components**: When creating compound components (like Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger), ensure all sub-components are properly exported.
- **Implement components fully before referencing**: Complete all component implementations before they are referenced in other files.
- **Export both named and default when needed**: For components that may be imported either way, provide both export types:
  ```typescript
  export function MyComponent() { /* ... */ }
  export default MyComponent;
  ```

### UI Component Structure

- **Follow the shadcn/ui pattern**: For UI components, follow the established pattern with proper interfaces and React.forwardRef usage.
- **Include proper TypeScript interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for all component props.
- **Use consistent naming conventions**: Follow the established naming patterns for components, props, and files.
- **Document component usage**: Include JSDoc comments for complex components.

## Dependency Management

- **Install all required dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and listed in package.json.
- **Check for peer dependencies**: When installing packages, check if they have peer dependencies that need to be installed.
- **Use consistent versioning**: Use consistent versioning strategies (e.g., fixed versions or compatible ranges).
- **Regularly update dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated to avoid security issues and benefit from improvements.

## Build Process

- **Test builds locally**: Run local builds frequently during development to catch issues early.
- **Check for warnings**: Address all warnings, not just errors, as they often indicate potential problems.
- **Validate CSS classes**: Ensure all Tailwind CSS classes are valid and properly configured.
- **Monitor bundle size**: Keep an eye on bundle size to avoid performance issues.

## Code Quality

- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow the established code formatting rules.
- **Write meaningful comments**: Include comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- **Follow the DRY principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common logic into reusable functions or components.
- **Use TypeScript effectively**: Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors early.

## Testing

- **Write tests for critical components**: Ensure critical components have proper test coverage.
- **Test edge cases**: Consider and test edge cases, not just the happy path.
- **Test accessibility**: Ensure components meet accessibility standards.
- **Test responsiveness**: Verify components work correctly on different screen sizes.

## Deployment

- **Review deployment logs**: Always check deployment logs for warnings and errors.
- **Test in production-like environments**: Test in environments that closely match production.
- **Use feature flags**: Consider using feature flags for major changes to enable gradual rollout.
- **Have a rollback plan**: Always have a plan for rolling back changes if issues are discovered.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Exports

**Problem**: Build fails with "X is not exported from Y" errors.

**Solution**:
1. Check if the component exists in the specified file.
2. Ensure the component is properly exported (named or default export).
3. If using barrel exports, ensure the component is included in the barrel file.
4. If the component doesn't exist, implement it following the established patterns.

### CSS Class Errors

**Problem**: Build fails with "X is not a valid Tailwind CSS class" errors.

**Solution**:
1. Check if the class is properly defined in the Tailwind configuration.
2. Ensure all required Tailwind plugins are installed and configured.
3. Use standard Tailwind classes when possible instead of custom classes.
4. If custom classes are needed, define them properly in the Tailwind configuration.

### Dependency Issues

**Problem**: Build fails with "Cannot find module X" errors.

**Solution**:
1. Install the missing dependency with npm or yarn.
2. Check if the dependency has peer dependencies that need to be installed.
3. Ensure the dependency is properly listed in package.json.
4. If the dependency is a local module, ensure the import path is correct.

## Educational Psychology Principles

As this platform is focused on educational psychology, all development should be guided by these core principles:

1. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components are accessible to users with disabilities.
2. **Inclusivity**: Design with diverse users in mind, considering different learning styles and needs.
3. **Evidence-based**: Implement features based on sound educational psychology research.
4. **User-centred**: Prioritize the needs of students, educators, and parents in all design decisions.
5. **Ethical considerations**: Handle sensitive data appropriately and consider the ethical implications of AI in education.

By following these best practices, we can maintain a high-quality codebase, prevent common issues, and ensure the EdPsych-AI-Education-Platform effectively serves its educational mission.
