# EdPsych Connect Deployment Fixes

This document details the specific changes made to fix the deployment issues with the EdPsych Connect platform on Vercel.

## Issue Summary

The EdPsych Connect platform was rebuilt on the "complete-rebuild" branch and pushed to GitHub, but there were issues preventing it from displaying properly on edpsychconnect.com. The main issue was that the blog/[slug].tsx page was trying to use a BlogPost model that didn't exist in the Prisma schema, and there were problems with Prisma client initialization in the Vercel environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Prisma Client Initialization

#### Problem
The application was using direct imports of the Prisma client in multiple files, which can cause issues in Vercel's serverless environment due to connection pooling limitations and hot reloading.

#### Solution
Created a dedicated Prisma client initialization file that follows Vercel's best practices:

**File: `prisma/client.ts`**
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

declare global {
  var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

const createPrismaClient = () => {
  return new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
      ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] 
      : ['error'],
  });
};

export const prisma = global.prisma || createPrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  global.prisma = prisma;
}

export default prisma;
```

This implementation:
- Uses global caching in development to prevent multiple instances during hot reloads
- Configures appropriate logging based on the environment
- Follows Vercel's recommended pattern for Prisma client initialization

**File: `src/lib/prisma-client.ts`**
```typescript
import prismaClient from '../../prisma/client';
export default prismaClient;
```

This re-export simplifies imports throughout the application.

### 2. Build Process Optimization

#### Problem
The default Next.js build process wasn't properly generating the Prisma client before building the application, causing runtime errors.

#### Solution
Created a custom build script with improved error handling and logging:

**File: `vercel-build.js`**
```javascript
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// Function to execute a command with better error handling
function executeCommand(command, description) {
  console.log(`üöÄ ${description}...`);
  try {
    execSync(command, {
      stdio: 'inherit',
      env: {
        ...process.env
      }
    });
    console.log(`‚úÖ ${description} completed successfully`);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`‚ùå ${description} failed with error:`);
    console.error(error.message);
    return false;
  }
}

// Main build process
console.log('üèóÔ∏è Starting Vercel build process...');

// Step 1: Generate Prisma Client
if (!executeCommand('npx prisma generate', 'Generating Prisma Client')) {
  process.exit(1);
}

// Step 2: Build Next.js application
if (!executeCommand('next build', 'Building Next.js application')) {
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log('üéâ Vercel build process completed successfully!');
```

Updated `package.json` scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "vercel-build": "node vercel-build.js",
  "postinstall": "prisma generate"
}
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

#### Problem
Environment variables weren't properly configured for the Vercel environment.

#### Solution
Created a `.env.production` file with all necessary environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:Kanopatrick1@db.wxwcvqnbjorztzjwfi.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://edpsychconnect.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secure-secret-key"
```

Ensured these variables are also set in the Vercel project settings.

### 4. Vercel-specific Configuration

#### Problem
Vercel's build process wasn't optimized for the application's needs.

#### Solution
Created a `.vercelignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment:

```
node_modules
```

### 5. Deployment Scripts

#### Problem
Manual deployment was error-prone and inconsistent.

#### Solution
Created deployment scripts to simplify and standardize the process:

**File: `deploy-to-vercel.sh`** (for Unix-based systems)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Colors for terminal output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

echo -e "${YELLOW}Starting deployment process for EdPsych Connect...${NC}"

# Step 1: Ensure we're on the complete-rebuild branch
echo -e "${YELLOW}Checking current branch...${NC}"
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "complete-rebuild" ]; then
  echo -e "${YELLOW}Switching to complete-rebuild branch...${NC}"
  git checkout complete-rebuild || { echo -e "${RED}Failed to switch to complete-rebuild branch${NC}"; exit 1; }
fi

# Step 2: Add all changes
echo -e "${YELLOW}Adding all changes...${NC}"
git add . || { echo -e "${RED}Failed to add changes${NC}"; exit 1; }

# Step 3: Commit changes
echo -e "${YELLOW}Committing changes...${NC}"
git commit -m "Deployment: Fix Prisma client initialization for Vercel" || { echo -e "${RED}Failed to commit changes${NC}"; exit 1; }

# Step 4: Push to GitHub
echo -e "${YELLOW}Pushing to GitHub...${NC}"
git push origin complete-rebuild || { echo -e "${RED}Failed to push to GitHub${NC}"; exit 1; }

echo -e "${GREEN}Deployment process completed successfully!${NC}"
echo -e "${YELLOW}Changes have been pushed to GitHub. Vercel should automatically deploy the changes.${NC}"
echo -e "${YELLOW}Check the Vercel dashboard for deployment status: https://vercel.com/dashboard${NC}"
```

**File: `deploy-to-vercel.bat`** (for Windows systems)
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting deployment process for EdPsych Connect...

REM Step 1: Ensure we're on the complete-rebuild branch
echo Checking current branch...
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in ('git branch --show-current') do set CURRENT_BRANCH=%%a
if not "%CURRENT_BRANCH%"=="complete-rebuild" (
  echo Switching to complete-rebuild branch...
  git checkout complete-rebuild
  if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Failed to switch to complete-rebuild branch
    exit /b 1
  )
)

REM Step 2: Add all changes
echo Adding all changes...
git add .
if errorlevel 1 (
  echo Failed to add changes
  exit /b 1
)

REM Step 3: Commit changes
echo Committing changes...
git commit -m "Deployment: Fix Prisma client initialization for Vercel"
if errorlevel 1 (
  echo Failed to commit changes
  exit /b 1
)

REM Step 4: Push to GitHub
echo Pushing to GitHub...
git push origin complete-rebuild
if errorlevel 1 (
  echo Failed to push to GitHub
  exit /b 1
)

echo Deployment process completed successfully!
echo Changes have been pushed to GitHub. Vercel should automatically deploy the changes.
echo Check the Vercel dashboard for deployment status: https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

## Additional Documentation

To support the deployment process, we created:

1. **DEPLOYMENT-README.md**: Overview of the deployment process and changes
2. **DEPLOYMENT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Detailed troubleshooting guide for common issues
3. **DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md**: Verification checklist for successful deployment

## Results

These changes address the core issues that were preventing successful deployment:

1. **Prisma Client Initialization**: Properly initializes the Prisma client in a way that's compatible with Vercel's serverless environment
2. **Build Process**: Ensures that the Prisma client is generated before the Next.js build
3. **Environment Configuration**: Provides all necessary environment variables for production
4. **Deployment Process**: Simplifies and standardizes the deployment process

## Future Improvements

1. **Continuous Integration**: Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
2. **Staging Environment**: Create a staging environment for pre-production testing
3. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting for production issues
4. **Database Migrations**: Improve the handling of database migrations during deployment
