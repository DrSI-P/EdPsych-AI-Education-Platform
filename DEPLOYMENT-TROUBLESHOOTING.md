# EdPsych Connect Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides detailed troubleshooting steps for common issues that may occur during the deployment of the EdPsych Connect platform to Vercel.

## Common Deployment Issues

### 1. Prisma Client Generation Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `Error: Failed to generate Prisma Client`
- Error message: `Command 'npx prisma generate' exited with 1`

**Solutions:**
- Verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly set in Vercel
- Check that the database is accessible from Vercel's deployment servers
- Ensure the Prisma schema is valid by running `npx prisma validate` locally
- Try adding `postinstall: "prisma generate"` to package.json scripts if not already present

### 2. Next.js Build Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `Command 'next build' exited with 1`
- TypeScript errors during build

**Solutions:**
- Check the build logs for specific TypeScript errors
- Verify that all imports are correct, especially the Prisma client imports
- Ensure that the polyfills are being loaded correctly
- Try setting `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` in next.config.js

### 3. Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `Error: P1001: Can't reach database server`
- Error message: `Error: P1003: Database does not exist`

**Solutions:**
- Verify that the DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted
- Check that the database server is running and accessible
- Ensure that the database user has the necessary permissions
- Add `?sslmode=require` to the DATABASE_URL if using Supabase

### 4. Environment Variable Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `Error: Missing environment variable: DATABASE_URL`
- Unexpected behavior due to missing configuration

**Solutions:**
- Check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify that the environment variables match those in .env.production
- Ensure that the environment variables are being loaded correctly
- Try redeploying after updating the environment variables

### 5. Vercel-specific Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `Command 'npm run vercel-build' exited with 1`
- Deployment succeeds but site shows 500 error

**Solutions:**
- Check that the vercel-build script is correctly defined in package.json
- Verify that the vercel.json file is correctly configured
- Ensure that the .vercelignore file is correctly set up
- Try deploying with the Vercel CLI for more detailed logs: `vercel --prod`

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debugging Prisma Issues

If you're experiencing Prisma-related issues, try these steps:

1. **Enable Verbose Logging**:
   ```javascript
   const prisma = new PrismaClient({
     log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
   });
   ```

2. **Check Prisma Version Compatibility**:
   Ensure that the Prisma version in package.json is compatible with your schema and Next.js version.

3. **Manually Generate Prisma Client**:
   Try generating the Prisma client manually before deployment:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. **Clear Prisma Cache**:
   Delete the generated Prisma client and regenerate it:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.prisma
   npm install
   ```

### Debugging Next.js Issues

If you're experiencing Next.js-related issues, try these steps:

1. **Build Locally First**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This can help identify issues before deploying to Vercel.

2. **Check for Browser API Usage**:
   Ensure that browser APIs (like localStorage) are only used in client-side code or properly polyfilled.

3. **Simplify the Application**:
   Temporarily comment out complex features to isolate the issue.

4. **Check for Memory Issues**:
   Vercel has memory limits for builds. Try optimizing your build process to use less memory.

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these troubleshooting steps, consider:

1. Checking the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
2. Reviewing the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs)
3. Searching for similar issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues)
4. Posting on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vercel)

## After Successful Deployment

Once your deployment is successful, verify that:

1. The blog pages load correctly at https://edpsychconnect.com/blog
2. Database operations work as expected
3. There are no runtime errors in the browser console
4. All features of the application work as expected

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Set up monitoring to catch any issues early:

1. Configure [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error tracking
2. Set up [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) for performance monitoring
3. Regularly check the Vercel logs for any warnings or errors
4. Set up alerts for critical errors
