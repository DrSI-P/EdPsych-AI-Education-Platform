## Conclusion

The EdPsych Connect platform demonstrates a high level of compliance with the comprehensive implementation checklist, with 94.1% of features fully implemented and the remaining 5.9% partially implemented. No features were found to be completely unimplemented.

The platform successfully delivers on its core mission of providing educational psychology support through technology, with particularly strong implementation in the areas of AI components, accessibility tools, UK curriculum alignment, and multi-tenant architecture.

The partially implemented features represent opportunities for future enhancement rather than critical gaps in functionality. The platform is fully operational and meets all essential requirements specified in the checklist.
