# EdPsych Connect Platform - Resolution Report

## Summary of Fixed Issues

### 1. Routing Conflicts Resolution
We successfully resolved the routing conflicts that were causing 404 errors on the live site by:
- Adding a `.vercelignore` file to exclude the `/src/app` directory from Vercel builds
- This prevents conflicts between the Pages Router (in `/pages`) and App Router (in `/src/app`) during build time
- The solution preserves all code while ensuring clean builds

### 2. Import Path Corrections
We fixed incorrect import paths in the analytics-dashboard.js file:
- Updated MainNavigation and Footer component imports to use the correct relative paths
- This resolved build failures and ensured the analytics dashboard page loads correctly

### 3. Build Verification
We confirmed that all pages now build and deploy successfully:
- Homepage (/)
- Student Portal (/student)
- Educator Resources (/educator)
- Analytics Dashboard (/analytics-dashboard)
- Settings (/settings)
- Resource pages (restorative-justice, adaptive-learning, special-needs, learning-styles)

### 4. Branding and Styling Consistency
We verified consistent application of branding and styling across all pages:
- Text gradient classes for headings
- Animation classes (fade-in, slide-up)
- Button styling and card components
- Responsive design with appropriate breakpoints
- Age-specific UI variations
