**Dr. Scott:**
"Hello, I'm Dr. Scott Ighavongbe-Patrick, Educational Psychologist and founder of EdPsych Connect. Welcome to a platform that represents my vision for transforming education through personalized, evidence-based approaches.

With over 12 years of experience as an Educational Psychologist, I've seen firsthand how traditional education can sometimes fail to meet the diverse needs of children and young people.

Our platform combines cutting-edge technology with sound educational psychology principles to create learning experiences that are engaging, accessible, and trauma-free. Whether you're a student looking for personalized learning paths, an educator seeking evidence-based resources, a parent supporting your child's educational journey, or a professional developing your practice – EdPsych Connect is designed with you in mind.

What makes us different is our commitment to understanding the underlying causes of learning challenges and addressing them through relationship-building and personalized support. We believe that every child deserves an education that recognizes their unique strengths and learning style.

As you explore the platform, you'll discover tools for adaptive learning, restorative justice practices, special educational needs support, and much more – all designed to empower learners and educators alike.

I invite you to join us on this journey to transform education and unlock the potential in every learner. Welcome to EdPsych Connect – where personalized learning meets educational psychology."

## Feature-Specific Tutorials

### Title: "Using Voice Input"
### Avatar: Alex (Student Avatar)
### Duration: 30-60 seconds
### Age Variation: Secondary (12-18)

**[Opening with voice input interface highlighted]**

**Alex:**
"One of the most helpful features of EdPsych Connect is the voice input system, which lets you speak instead of type whenever you see a microphone icon. Let me show you how it works.

To use voice input, simply click on the microphone icon that appears next to any text input field. When the icon turns purple, that means it's listening and you can start speaking. Try to speak clearly at a normal pace – there's no need to speak slowly or loudly.

You can use voice input for many things: searching for resources, answering questions, writing reflections, or navigating the platform with voice commands like 'go to mathematics' or 'show my progress.'

If you need to pause, the system will wait for you to continue. When you're finished speaking, either click the microphone again or just stop speaking for a few seconds, and the system will process what you've said.

You can always edit your text after using voice input if you need to make any corrections. The more you use the voice feature, the better it gets at recognizing your speech patterns.

Voice input is especially helpful if you find typing challenging, if you think better when speaking, or if you're working on a device where typing is inconvenient.

Give it a try now by clicking the microphone icon and saying hello!"

"Did you know you can talk to EdPsych Connect instead of typing? It's super easy and really fun to use! Let me show you how.

Whenever you see a picture of a microphone like this one, you can click on it to start talking. When it turns purple, that means it's listening to you – just like when a friend is paying attention to what you're saying.

You can use your voice to search for things you're interested in, answer questions in activities, or tell stories and write about your ideas. You can even say things like "show me science activities" or "go to my progress page" to move around the platform.

Just speak in your normal voice – not too fast and not too slow. When you're done talking, you can click the microphone again, or just wait a moment, and your words will appear on the screen like magic!

If the words don't come out exactly right, don't worry! You can always fix them afterward by typing or trying again with your voice.

Using your voice can be really helpful if you have big ideas but don't like typing, or if spelling is sometimes tricky for you.

Want to try it now? Click the microphone and say hello!"

You can use your voice to find fun activities, answer questions in games, or tell amazing stories. You can even say things like "show me dinosaur games" or "I want to draw" to find activities you like.

Just talk like you're talking to a friend. When you're finished, the microphone will stop listening, and your words will appear right here on the screen – like magic!

If the words don't look right, that's okay! You can try again or ask a grown-up to help.

Talking instead of typing is great if you have lots of ideas but don't like writing them down, or if you're still learning how to spell.

Let's try it now! Press the microphone button and say hello!"

**[Opening with accessibility settings page]**

**Alex:**
"EdPsych Connect is designed to be accessible for everyone, with lots of ways to customize how you see and interact with the platform. Let's explore the accessibility settings that can make your learning experience more comfortable.

To find these settings, click on the gear icon in the top right corner, then select 'Accessibility' from the menu. This opens your accessibility control panel with several options to customize your experience.

The Display section lets you adjust how things look on screen. You can choose high contrast mode to make text stand out more clearly against backgrounds. The text size slider lets you make text larger or smaller. You can also change fonts to ones that might be easier for you to read, like the dyslexia-friendly font option.

In the Audio section, you can adjust volume levels for different types of sounds, or turn on text-to-speech which can read content aloud to you. You can choose different voices and adjust the speaking rate to what works best for you.

The Interaction section has options for how you navigate and input information. You can enable keyboard navigation shortcuts, adjust how long buttons need to be pressed, or turn on voice input as your primary way of interacting.

The Motion section lets you reduce or eliminate animations and transitions if you find them distracting or uncomfortable.

All your settings are saved automatically and will be applied whenever you log in, on any device. You can also create different profiles for different situations – like one for reading and another for interactive activities.

Remember, there's no right or wrong way to set up your accessibility features – it's all about what works best for you and your learning style."

### Age Variation: Secondary (12-18)

**[Opening with learning style settings page]**

**Alex:**
"One of the most powerful features of EdPsych Connect is how it adapts to your unique learning style. Let me show you how you can personalize your learning experience to match how you learn best.

Your learning profile is automatically created as you use the platform, but you can view and adjust it anytime by clicking on 'Learning Preferences' in your profile menu. This opens your learning style dashboard.

The platform recognizes four main learning preferences: Visual, where you learn best through images and diagrams; Auditory, where you process information well through listening; Reading/Writing, where text-based information works best for you; and Kinesthetic, where you learn through doing and interacting.

Most people use a combination of these styles, and your profile shows your current learning preference pattern based on your activities. You can see which types of content you engage with most successfully and how your preferences might vary across different subjects.

You can manually adjust these settings if you already know your preferences, or you can take the learning style assessment for more detailed insights. The assessment takes about 10 minutes and involves different types of activities to identify how you process information most effectively.

As you use EdPsych Connect, content will be presented in ways that align with your learning preferences. For example, if you have a strong visual preference, you'll see more diagrams and visual explanations. If you prefer auditory learning, you'll have more options for audio content.

You can also set subject-specific preferences. For instance, you might prefer visual learning for science but reading/writing for literature.

Remember, learning styles aren't fixed – they can evolve over time and vary by context. The platform will continue to adapt as your patterns change, but you can update your preferences anytime."

"The assessment tools in EdPsych Connect go beyond traditional testing to provide meaningful insights into student learning. Let me show you how to create and manage assessments that support student growth.

In your Educator Portal, select the 'Assessments' tab to access the assessment dashboard. Here you'll see any assessments you've already created, along with templates and recommended assessments based on your curriculum areas.

To create a new assessment, click the 'Create Assessment' button. You'll be guided through several steps: First, select your assessment purpose – whether it's diagnostic, formative, or summative. Then choose your subject area and specific learning objectives.

Next, you'll build your assessment content. You can choose from various question types including multiple choice, short answer, file upload, voice recording, or interactive activities. For each question, you can set difficulty levels and tag the specific skills being assessed.

The platform offers intelligent suggestions for questions based on your objectives, which you can use or modify. You can also create your own questions from scratch.

In the settings section, you can customize how the assessment adapts to student responses, set time limits if needed, and choose accessibility options. You can also decide whether to show immediate feedback or review responses later.

Once your assessment is ready, you can preview it from a student perspective before assigning it to individuals or groups. You can schedule when it becomes available and set completion deadlines.

After students complete the assessment, you'll receive detailed analytics showing not just scores, but patterns in responses, time spent on different sections, and connections to learning styles and potential areas for support.

Remember that assessments in EdPsych Connect are designed to inform teaching and learning, not just measure performance. The insights you gain can help you tailor your approach to individual student needs."

To access your progress information, click on the 'Progress' tab in your main navigation. This opens your personal progress dashboard with several different views of your learning journey.

## Educational Psychology Features

### Title: "Understanding Restorative Justice"
### Avatar: Dr. Taylor (Educator Avatar)
### Duration: 90-120 seconds
### User Variation: Educator

**[Opening with restorative justice dashboard]**

**Dr. Taylor:**
"Restorative Justice represents a powerful approach to building community and addressing conflict in educational settings. Let me introduce you to the Restorative Justice tools available on EdPsych Connect.

Restorative practices are based on the principle that relationships are central to learning and wellbeing. When harm occurs, the focus is on repairing relationships rather than simply assigning punishment. This approach helps build stronger communities while developing important social and emotional skills.

In your Educator Portal, the Restorative Justice section provides resources and tools organized into several key areas:

The Community Building toolkit contains activities designed to develop trust, empathy, and connection within your classroom or school. These proactive approaches help prevent conflicts by creating a strong sense of belonging and mutual respect.

The Circle Process resources guide you through facilitating restorative circles – structured conversations where everyone has an equal opportunity to speak and be heard. You'll find templates for different types of circles, from community-building to addressing specific incidents.

The Conversation Frameworks section provides scripts and guidance for restorative conversations between individuals involved in conflicts. These frameworks help ensure that all perspectives are heard and that the focus remains on understanding impact and finding solutions.

The Agreement Tracking tools help you document and monitor restorative agreements made during the process. This supports accountability while maintaining the supportive nature of the approach.

The Staff Training section contains professional development resources to help you and your colleagues develop skills in restorative facilitation.

Finally, the Parent Education resources help you introduce restorative concepts to families and create consistency between school and home approaches.

Throughout these resources, you'll find case studies, video demonstrations, and research evidence supporting the effectiveness of restorative approaches in educational settings.

Remember that restorative justice is not just a set of techniques but a philosophical approach that values relationships, responsibility, and reintegration. These tools are designed to support your journey in creating a more restorative educational environment."

"EdPsych Connect offers comprehensive tools to support learners with diverse needs. Let me guide you through the Special Needs Support features available to you as an educator.

In your Educator Portal, the Special Needs section provides resources organized to help you understand, plan for, and support students with various learning differences and needs.

The Personalized Interventions area allows you to create customized support plans based on individual student profiles. The system suggests evidence-based strategies matched to specific learning needs, which you can adapt and implement in your classroom.

The Progress Monitoring tools help you track the effectiveness of interventions with visual data displays that make it easy to identify patterns and adjust approaches as needed. These tools focus on growth rather than comparison to standardized norms.

In the Emotional Regulation section, you'll find resources to help students develop self-awareness and coping strategies. This includes pattern recognition tools that help identify triggers and effective calming techniques for individual students.

The Digital Expression tools provide alternative ways for students to demonstrate their understanding beyond traditional writing or speaking. This includes visual mapping, audio recording, and multimedia creation options.

The Parent-Teacher Communication system facilitates collaborative support between school and home, with secure messaging, shared resource libraries, and meeting scheduling tools.

The IEP/504 Plan section helps streamline the creation and management of formal support documents, with templates aligned to legal requirements and the ability to track goals and accommodations.

Throughout these resources, you'll find practical implementation guides, classroom strategies, and connections to relevant research and best practices.

Remember that these tools are designed to support your professional judgment, not replace it. Your knowledge of individual students remains central to effective support planning.

By using these features, you can create a more inclusive learning environment that recognizes and responds to the diverse needs of all students in your care."

### Age Variation: Secondary (12-18)

**[Opening with emotional regulation tools dashboard]**

**Alex:**
"Learning how to understand and manage your emotions is an important skill that can help with both learning and life in general. Let me show you the emotional regulation tools available to you on EdPsych Connect.

In your Student Portal, you can access the Emotional Wellbeing section from your dashboard. This opens a private space where you can explore tools to help you understand and manage your emotions.

The Emotion Check-In tool gives you a quick way to identify and record how you're feeling. You can use the emotion wheel to select emotions, adjust intensity levels, and add notes about what might be influencing your feelings. Over time, this creates a personal pattern map that can help you understand your emotional responses.

The Strategies Library contains different techniques for managing various emotions. These are organized by emotion type and intensity, so you can find approaches that work for specific situations – whether you're feeling anxious before a presentation, frustrated with a difficult assignment, or overwhelmed by multiple deadlines.

The Mindfulness section offers guided practices ranging from quick 1-minute breathing exercises to longer meditation sessions. These can help you develop awareness and the ability to respond to emotions rather than react automatically.

In the Reflection Journal, you can record your experiences with different strategies and track what works best for you in different situations. This builds your personal toolkit for emotional regulation.

All of these tools are completely private – your entries and usage are not shared with teachers or parents unless you specifically choose to share them.

Remember that emotions themselves aren't good or bad – they're important signals that give us information. These tools aren't about suppressing emotions but about understanding them and responding in ways that support your wellbeing and learning."

**Parent Guide:**
"Effective communication between home and school is essential for supporting your child's education. Let me show you how the communication tools in EdPsych Connect can help strengthen this important partnership.

In your Parent Portal, the Communication Center provides several ways to connect with your child's teachers and school. This creates a streamlined, organized approach to school-home communication that respects everyone's time while ensuring important information is shared effectively.

The Messages section works like an email system specifically for school communications. You can send and receive messages from teachers, view conversation history, and attach files when needed. The system automatically translates messages if you and the teacher speak different languages.

The Meeting Scheduler allows you to book parent-teacher conferences or other meetings based on available times. You can include notes about what you'd like to discuss, and after meetings, shared notes can be added to create a record of discussions and agreed actions.

In the Shared Goals section, you and your child's teachers can collaborate on specific learning or development goals. This creates clarity about priorities and allows progress to be tracked and celebrated together.

The Home Strategy Library contains resources recommended by your child's teachers to support learning at home. These are specifically selected to complement classroom activities and match your child's current development needs.

The Updates section provides regular information about classroom activities, upcoming events, and your child's engagement and progress. These updates focus on meaningful information rather than overwhelming you with details.

All communications are organized by topic and child, making it easy to find information when you need it. You can also set notification preferences to control how and when you receive alerts about new communications.

Remember that effective communication is a two-way process. These tools are designed to make it easier for you to be an active partner in your child's education while respecting the boundaries between school and family life."

**Math Specialist:**
"Welcome to the Mathematics resources on EdPsych Connect. I'm your Math Specialist, and I'm here to show you how our platform can support your mathematical learning in ways that match how you think and learn.

The Mathematics section is organized to help you build both conceptual understanding and practical skills. Unlike traditional math learning that often focuses only on procedures, our approach helps you understand the 'why' behind the 'how.'

In your dashboard, you'll see resources organized by topic areas like Number, Algebra, Geometry, Statistics, and Calculus. Within each area, content is arranged in learning sequences that build on previous understanding.

What makes our math resources special is how they adapt to your learning style. If you're a visual learner, you'll see more graphical explanations and visual models. If you learn better through reading or writing, you'll get more text-based explanations. If you're a hands-on learner, you'll find interactive simulations and practical applications.

The Problem-Solving Lab provides opportunities to apply mathematical thinking to real-world situations, with guidance that matches your current understanding and preferred approach to problem-solving.

In the Practice Zone, you can strengthen specific skills with adaptive exercises that adjust to your mastery level. These provide immediate feedback and alternative explanations if you're struggling with particular concepts.

The Connections section helps you see how mathematical concepts relate to each other and to other subject areas, creating a more coherent understanding of mathematics as a whole.

Remember that you can use voice input for mathematical expressions, or use the equation editor for more complex notation. You can also access support at any point if you get stuck on a particular concept or problem."

**[Opening with privacy settings dashboard]**

**Dr. Taylor:**
"EdPsych Connect takes data privacy seriously, especially when it comes to educational data. Let me explain how data is used, protected, and managed on the platform, and how you can control privacy settings as an educator.

All data collected on EdPsych Connect serves specific educational purposes – whether that's personalizing learning experiences, providing insights into student progress, or improving platform functionality. We follow data minimization principles, collecting only what's necessary for these purposes.

In your Privacy Dashboard, you can see what types of data are collected and how they're used. This includes student activity data, assessment results, and communication records. For each data type, you can see the retention period and access controls.

The Consent Management section shows the consent basis for different data processing activities. For students under 13, this includes parental consent records. As an educator, you can help manage consent for your students and see which features require specific consent.

In the Data Access Controls, you can manage who can see different types of information about your students. This includes other educators, school administrators, and third-party tools integrated with the platform. The principle of least privilege applies – access is limited to those who need it for specific educational purposes.

The Security Practices section explains how data is protected, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. You'll also find information about data breach notification procedures.

If you need to export data for school records or when students transition to different environments, the Data Export tools allow you to download information in standard formats.

Remember that as an educator, you play an important role in protecting student privacy by using secure practices like strong passwords and being mindful of what information you share in communications."
