# Personalized Learning Paths Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing truly personalized learning paths in the EdPsych Connect platform, addressing the gaps in the current implementation and aligning with the platform's educational psychology principles.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths
- Visually engaging interface with clear progress tracking
- Well-structured learning journey visualization
- UK curriculum-aligned subject content organization
- Basic AI recommendation placeholders
- Responsive design with accessibility considerations

### Gaps Identified
1. **Static Content**: Current implementation uses mock data rather than dynamically generated content
2. **Limited Personalization**: No real user data integration or individual starting point assessment
3. **No Adaptive Algorithms**: Missing connection to the adaptive learning algorithms already implemented
4. **No Learning Style Recognition**: Does not identify or adapt to individual learning styles
5. **No Interest-Based Adaptation**: Content is not adapted based on learner interests
6. **No Systematic Gap Analysis**: Does not identify or address curriculum coverage gaps
7. **Limited Assessment Integration**: No connection to assessment results for path adjustment
8. **No Evidence-Based Progression**: Paths do not adapt based on educational psychology principles
