## Completion Criteria

All items in this checklist must be completed and validated before moving on to the Visual Design Excellence phase. Each item should be:

1. Implemented completely
2. Tested thoroughly
3. Documented appropriately
4. Committed and pushed to the repository

Once all items are checked, the Critical Functionality Enhancements phase can be considered complete.
