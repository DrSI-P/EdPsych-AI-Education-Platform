# EdPsych Connect Design System Foundation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive design system foundation for the EdPsych Connect platform. The design system aims to create a visually striking, award-worthy educational platform that serves diverse user groups from nursery through secondary levels while maintaining professional standards and global appeal.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Evidence-Based Design**: All visual elements are informed by educational psychology research on how visual design affects learning and engagement.
2. **Age-Appropriate Adaptability**: Visual elements adapt to different age groups while maintaining brand consistency.
3. **Inclusive Accessibility**: Design elements ensure equitable access for all users, including those with special needs.
4. **Global Appeal**: Visual language transcends cultural boundaries while respecting UK educational context.
5. **Professional Excellence**: Design maintains educational credibility while being engaging and approachable.

- No justified text that could create "rivers" of white space

### Interactive Elements
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Touch targets are sufficiently sized (minimum 44x44px)
- Hover/focus states don't trigger layout shifts

### Specialized Modes
- High contrast mode available
- Reduced motion option for animations
- Screen reader optimizations
- Keyboard navigation enhancements

## Age-Appropriate Adaptations

### Nursery (Ages 3-5)
- Larger UI elements with rounded corners
- Bright, primary colors with high contrast
- Character-based navigation and feedback
- Simplified layouts with clear visual cues
- Larger touch targets for developing motor skills

### Early Primary (Ages 5-7)
- Friendly, approachable UI elements
